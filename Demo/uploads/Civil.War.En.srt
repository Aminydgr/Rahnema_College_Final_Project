{\an7}Subtitle :<font color="#FF9000"><b> ByME</b></font>

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,554
We are now closer
than we have ever been.

3
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:31,289
We are now closer than we have ever been.

4
00:00:31,313 --> 00:00:33,414
To victory.

5
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:40,734
Some... Some are already
calling it the greatest.

6
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:46,746
Some are already calling it
the greatest victory in

7
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,774
the history of mankind.

8
00:00:58,374 --> 00:01:00,234
Some are calling it already.

9
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:06,998
We are closer than we
have ever been to victory.

10
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:09,566
Some are already
calling it the greatest

11
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,594
victory in the history
of military campaigns.

12
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:21,792
Today I can announce that the so called

13
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:25,272
western forces of Texas and California

14
00:01:25,448 --> 00:01:29,749
have suffered a very great
loss, a very great defeat

15
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:34,006
at the hands of the fighting men and women
of the United States military.

16
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:39,464
The people of Texas and California
should know that they will be welcomed

17
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:41,983
back to these United States

18
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:46,280
as soon as their illegal
secessionist government is deposed.

19
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:51,980
I can also confirm that the Florida
alliance has failed in its attempt to

20
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:56,349
force the brave people of the
Carolinas into joining the insurrection.

21
00:01:56,773 --> 00:02:02,824
Citizens of America, we are now
closer than ever to a historic victory

22
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:06,944
as we eliminate the final
pockets of resistance.

23
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:11,144
God bless you all and God bless America.

24
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,875
you okay?

25
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:07,204
- What?
- You're Lee Smith.

26
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:10,931
This is crazy.

27
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:13,273
- Take this.
- No. I can't do that

28
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:15,604
Take it and put it on.

29
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,204
Thank you so much.

30
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,784
We woke up in Des Moines, Iowa,

31
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:42,724
and he's wearing my wedding ring.

32
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:53,000
Jesus, the wifi is fucking slow.

33
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:56,056
The word I'm getting is July 4.

34
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,744
The word you're getting?

35
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:00,817
Like everyone in this room hasn't already
heard this bullshit.

36
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:04,514
The life force and the
optics are irresistable.

37
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:08,149
The western forces are
stopped 120 miles from the sea.

38
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:10,212
The Florida alliance
armed for south of them.

39
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:13,990
The WF one had stopped. They
stalled and lost their supply lines.

40
00:07:14,014 --> 00:07:16,273
But it's the race to Berlin.

41
00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:18,613
There's no coordination
between the secessionists.

42
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:20,054
You watch.

43
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,254
As soon as DC falls,
they'll turn on each other.

44
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:29,194
- Really?
- It's every night this week.

45
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:31,194
They'll switch to the generator.

46
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,284
Uploaded.
Almost done.

47
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,524
So where you kids headed tomorrow?

48
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:44,844
Staying in New York a while
or adventuring out?

49
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:50,576
- Fuck you.
- Come on, Jim.

50
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,750
So you can beat us there?

51
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:54,084
I couldn't beat you in a brisk walk.

52
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,012
We're going there,
we're going to DC,

53
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:02,508
Danny.
Tomorrow morning, first thing.

54
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:03,871
Yeah, front line. I figured.

55
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:06,224
No, no, not at the front line.

56
00:08:07,364 --> 00:08:08,364
DC.

57
00:08:16,284 --> 00:08:19,104
- What?
- I'm gonna photograph the president.

58
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:22,020
Joe's gonna interview.

59
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:26,684
Photograph and interview the
president in DC.

60
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:29,967
That's the idea.

61
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:32,336
What the fuck are you talking about?

62
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,644
Are you serious?

63
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:37,910
They shoot journalists
on site in the Capitol.

64
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,965
They literally see us as enemy
combatants.

65
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:43,159
Not a single interview in
14 months.

66
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:45,604
Now how you gonna do this?

67
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:48,644
We get there before anyone else does.

68
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:50,756
You think there's a rush?

69
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,944
To get executed on the south lawn.

70
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:56,596
Same. July 4, July 10. West coast forces.

71
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,628
Fucking Portland Maoists.
It's all the same.

72
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:04,624
DC is falling and the president is dead
inside the mouth.

73
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:08,080
Interviewing is the only story left.

74
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:10,704
It's not a story if
it never gets filed.

75
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:15,184
Lee, can I please talk you
out of this bullshit?

76
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:19,492
What do you think the
route's gonna be like?

77
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:21,966
There's nothing direct, the interstates are
vaporized,

78
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,769
and you can't get anywhere near Philly.

79
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:24,944
So you gotta go west.

80
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:28,604
Maybe as far as Pittsburgh,
then circle in from West Virginia.

81
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:32,884
You already had that route
all figured out, huh, Sammy?

82
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:38,324
Yeah, okay. I was kind of
looking to get down there myself.

83
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:40,070
- I knew it
- Not DC.

84
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:43,024
I don't want a piece of your suicide pact.

85
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:45,519
I want Charlottesville front line.

86
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,844
- Sammy
- Hear me out.

87
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:49,019
Just cause I'm a rival news out.

88
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:50,084
They're not a fucking vice.

89
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:53,184
You think I care if you fight with
whatever's left of the New York Times?

90
00:09:56,124 --> 00:10:00,144
You're worried I'm too old,
I can't move quick enough.

91
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:34,874
Aren't you? Sure,

92
00:10:35,814 --> 00:10:41,846
yes. But you

93
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,046
gonna make me explain
why I have to be there

94
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,350
it's the front line, you want,

95
00:10:47,374 --> 00:10:50,344
half the press in this room are gonna
be heading there within 24 hours.

96
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:52,742
You want me to walk
around this fucking room

97
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:54,234
begging for a ride?

98
00:10:57,334 --> 00:11:01,759
I'm gonna finish the upload
upstairs and pass out.

99
00:11:01,783 --> 00:11:04,334
Hopefully we'll be done
by the time I wake up.

100
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:12,799
My vote. If Sammy wants a ride, I'm good
with it.

101
00:11:12,823 --> 00:11:14,081
You two figure it out.

102
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,391
Thank you, Lee.

103
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:18,314
Yeah, thank you, Lee.

104
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:19,894
Make me the bad guy.

105
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,762
Ma'am, just to warn you,

106
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:25,986
if you take the elevator, we
do sometimes have power cuts,

107
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,865
which might mean a delay
in your journey.

108
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:29,272
A delay?

109
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:31,109
We offer the option to use the stairs.

110
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:33,324
I'm on the 10th floor.

111
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:36,444
Your choice, ma'am.

112
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:46,416
Miss Smith? Hey,

113
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,084
it's me. Do you remember me earlier?

114
00:11:50,264 --> 00:11:51,865
Yeah, how did you know I stay...

115
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:54,122
Yeah, I didn't mean to, like, stalk,

116
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,644
but I know a lot of
the press use this hotel

117
00:11:57,668 --> 00:12:03,716
and I wanted to say thanks.
And I want to give you this back.

118
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,310
Oh, no, it's okay. Keep it.

119
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:06,916
- But,
- keep it.

120
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,136
And buy a helmet and some Kevlar. Okay.

121
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,119
If you're planning on attending any more
stuff like that.

122
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:16,106
I am. Yeah, going to. I'm a photographer.
And I want to be a war photographer.

123
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,954
Actually.

124
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:21,366
By the way, you have the
same name as my hero,

125
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,336
Lee Miller.

126
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,674
She was one of the first
photojournalists in knockout.

127
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:27,243
You know her stuff.

128
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:29,174
Yeah, I know who Lee Miller is.

129
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:34,392
Of course. But I want to say
that you're also one of my heroes.

130
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:38,537
And you've got the same
name too.

131
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:40,950
Well, thank you.

132
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:42,194
I'm in good company.

133
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:45,531
What's your name?

134
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:48,390
Jesse.
Jessie Cullen.

135
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:52,565
So, Jesse, I've gotta walk up ten flights
of stairs,

136
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:55,714
but if I ever see you again,

137
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:59,034
you better be wearing Kevlar and that's vest.

138
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:01,634
You bet.

139
00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:15,167
A word? What the fuck is that girl doing?

140
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:20,074
Right, so she came over to the
table last night after you went to bed.

141
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:24,914
She's very cool and wanted to tag along,

142
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:27,159
so she's coming with us.

143
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:29,733
Lee, you let Sammy tag along?

144
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:31,816
You think he's gonna
do well running for cover

145
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,632
with bullets flying over his head?

146
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:35,714
She's a kid, did you notice that?

147
00:15:36,054 --> 00:15:39,262
She's like 23 and
she wants to do what we do.

148
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:41,114
She wants to do what you do.

149
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,230
We had to start one day.

150
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:46,874
Were you more children than
she? She is now.

151
00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:59,194
Whatever happens, she goes
no further than Charlottesville.

152
00:16:06,454 --> 00:16:08,674
All right, let's go.

153
00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:48,384
You don't want to miss this.

154
00:16:48,408 --> 00:17:06,698


155
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:08,254


156
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:08,407
Mister President, do you regret any action

157
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:11,131
implemented during
your third term in office?

158
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:13,420
I'm not gonna softball him, Sammy.

159
00:18:13,612 --> 00:18:18,308
In retrospect, Mister president, do you
still think it was wise to disband the FBI?

160
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:19,746
Passive aggressive.

161
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:24,964
Sir, how is your policy evolving in the use
of airstrikes against american citizens?

162
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:26,384
Now we're talking.

163
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:30,424
Just be sure you get the words out
before the piano wire gets too tight.

164
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:35,184
There's a gas station station up ahead.

165
00:18:37,164 --> 00:18:38,184
Looks open.

166
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:44,984
I've got over half a tank.

167
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,624
What do you think?

168
00:18:56,964 --> 00:18:59,464
Any chance to refuel.
We should take.

169
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:00,788
Ok.

170
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:31,144
- Can I help you folks?
- Just looking for gas.

171
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:36,279
Got a local fuel permit?

172
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:39,733
No, we're actually
just passing through.

173
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:44,186
Can't help. Sorry.

174
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,985
Sir, we pay.

175
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:48,372
I was never gonna give it for free.

176
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,749
- Over the odds.
- What's over the odds?

177
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,224
300 for
half a tank and two cans.

178
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:57,844
300 buys you a sandwich.

179
00:19:57,868 --> 00:20:00,924
We got ham or
cheese.

180
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:02,904
300 canadian.

181
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:08,224
Okay.

182
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:17,902
Hey. Stretching the legs?

183
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,769
No, I just saw
something.

184
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:22,004
This isn't going to take long.

185
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:23,084
Sure.

186
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:43,604
- Are we good?
- Yeah, we're good.

187
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,944
I don't mind if she looks.

188
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:05,924
- Who are they?
- Looters.

189
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:14,221
Actually not that guy went to high school
together.

190
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:17,757
Didn't talk to me much.

191
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:20,564
We just want to
talk to him now.

192
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:25,222
We've been debating
what to do with him

193
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:26,804
for two days now.

194
00:22:27,884 --> 00:22:29,304
Go around in circles.

195
00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:32,824
Tell you what,

196
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,080
why don't you put us and them

197
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:38,744
out of our misery and make a call?

198
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,384
I'll put rounds in them right now.

199
00:22:42,884 --> 00:22:44,664
Or we'll beat them up a little more.

200
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:47,418
Strap them to the front.

201
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,484
We'll let them go after a couple days.

202
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,764
Flip a coin if you like.

203
00:23:02,384 --> 00:23:06,144
Would you stand with that?

204
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:06,884
Yeah.

205
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:12,644
I'd like to take your picture.

206
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:24,304
Okay. You stand over there.

207
00:23:24,684 --> 00:23:27,384
Yeah. Where you want me to do?

208
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:31,464
Uh, between the two.

209
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:43,204
I didn't take a photo.
I didn't take a single photo.

210
00:23:43,284 --> 00:23:44,517
I didn't even remember.

211
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,052
I have cameras on me,
like. Oh, my God.

212
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:49,790
Like. Like, why didn't I
just tell him not to shoot?

213
00:23:49,814 --> 00:23:51,434
They're probably gonna kill that manual.

214
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,231
How do you know?

215
00:23:52,255 --> 00:23:55,178
He doesn't know. But that's besides the
point.

216
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:58,336
Once you start asking
yourself those questions,

217
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,182
You can't stop.
So we don't ask. We record.

218
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:02,492
So other people ask.

219
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:05,054
Want to be a journalist? That's the
job.

220
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:05,823
Hey, Lee.

221
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:07,874
- What?
- Back off.

222
00:24:08,254 --> 00:24:09,686
What am I saying that's wrong?

223
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,990
I'm not saying it's wrong.

224
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:12,231
she just shook up.

225
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:14,354
Lee doesn't understand shook up.

226
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:15,014
Whoa.

227
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,666
I'm not being protective of her.

228
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,277
You're the idiot who let her in
this car.

229
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:25,587
What happened back there is nothing
in comparison to what we're heading into.

230
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:27,054
You need to understand.

231
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:31,019
Holy shit.

232
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:36,631
She's the back seat. It's both in
kindergarden and an old child's home.

233
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:39,158
How did this happen?

234
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:40,422
Lee, what the fuck?

235
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,494
She's right.

236
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:48,354
I won't make that mistake again

237
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:58,901
terms of the so called peace summit

238
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:02,674
could only be rejected,
fully rejected, by all.

239
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:08,694
To the secessionists, I say only this.

240
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:15,614
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America.

241
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:21,146
We stand ready to fulfill the
promise of our forefathers.

242
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,214
To the flag, to the nation,

243
00:25:25,674 --> 00:25:26,814
and to God.

244
00:25:31,294 --> 00:25:32,940
Stop here a minute.

245
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:36,109
Like a good place
for a toilet break.

246
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:37,154
Just pull it.

247
00:25:58,194 --> 00:25:59,254
Come with me.

248
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,074
Shoot it.

249
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:38,867
Shoot the helicopter?

250
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:41,994
Yeah. It's gonna
make a good image.

251
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:13,634
That V2. You don't see
them around much.

252
00:27:14,094 --> 00:27:17,194
Yeah, they're my dad's cameras, actually.

253
00:27:18,774 --> 00:27:20,581
Don't worry. He's not dead.

254
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:25,714
He's sitting on his farm in Missouri
pretending like none of this is happening.

255
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:47,404
Lee, I'm sorry for jamming
my way into your ride, okay?

256
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:49,606
I know you're really angry about it.

257
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,182
And I know you think
I don't know shit, but...

258
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:54,298
I'm not angry about that. Jesse.

259
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:57,179
I don't care what you do or don't
know.

260
00:27:57,203 --> 00:27:59,194
Okay? But you are angry with me.

261
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:01,813
There is no version of this

262
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:03,574
that isn't a mistake.

263
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:06,522
I know because I'm it.

264
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:09,216
Joe and Sammy are it.

265
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:12,174
- It's my choice,
- Right.

266
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:15,331
And I'll remember that
when you lose your shit

267
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:17,974
or you get blown up or shot.

268
00:28:21,394 --> 00:28:23,194
Would you photograph that moment?

269
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:24,294
If I got shot?

270
00:28:26,714 --> 00:28:27,934
What do you think.

271
00:28:42,394 --> 00:28:46,736
Every time I survived the
war zone and got the photo,

272
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,323
I thought I was sending a
warning, home.

273
00:28:50,347 --> 00:28:52,494
Don't do this.

274
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:55,234
But here we are.

275
00:28:57,974 --> 00:29:01,714
- So it's existential.
- What is?

276
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:03,754
What's eating you?

277
00:29:07,774 --> 00:29:09,754
Don't worry about me, Sammy.

278
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:16,114
Am I allowed to say
I remember you at her age,

279
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:20,562
and I wasn't so different?
- You weren't so different.

280
00:29:20,586 --> 00:29:22,708
You think you're being hard on her,

281
00:29:22,732 --> 00:29:24,724
and I think you're being hard on yourself.

282
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:26,604
Okay, Ryder.

283
00:29:26,628 --> 00:29:27,792
Damn it, Lee,

284
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:31,288
Stop. I'm speaking truth.

285
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:33,913
And for the record, sure,
I'm worried about that girl.

286
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:36,484
And I'm worried about you, too.

287
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,484
What are you worrying about Lee for?

288
00:29:42,424 --> 00:29:45,284
Lee's lost her faith in
the power of journalism.

289
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:48,617
State of the nation is QED.

290
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:50,298
I can't answer to that, Sammy.

291
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:58,164
But I can tell you this gunfire is
getting extremely fucking hard.

292
00:29:59,704 --> 00:30:01,687
Look at that shit.
Light up this guy.

293
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:03,364
It's not our story.

294
00:30:03,944 --> 00:30:06,684
Yeah, but, you know,

295
00:30:07,424 --> 00:30:08,631
bang, bang.

296
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:11,185
We're not going anywhere near that in
the dark.

297
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:14,263
But, Senna,

298
00:30:14,287 --> 00:30:17,144
they're still at it.
We'll take a look.

299
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:24,124
Cool.

300
00:30:31,644 --> 00:30:32,644
Thanks.

301
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,698
Action tomorrow.

302
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:07,624
We going down there?

303
00:31:07,644 --> 00:31:08,644
Yeah.

304
00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:14,588
But not you.

305
00:31:14,612 --> 00:31:17,584
You're gonna hang back.

306
00:31:19,084 --> 00:31:20,481
I don't want to hang back.

307
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:21,544
You have to hanging back.

308
00:31:23,124 --> 00:31:25,264
I'm not hanging back.

309
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,764
You should see your face.

310
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:33,604
Stomach don't turn right,

311
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:37,844
you don't get a minute of sleep tonight.

312
00:31:39,104 --> 00:31:43,054
My advice, don't expect to sleep

313
00:31:43,078 --> 00:31:46,284
That way, if you do it,
it's a nice surprise.

314
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,044
You gonna sleep?

315
00:31:55,324 --> 00:31:57,144
I got out a bit adequate.

316
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:04,704
I know. It's okay.

317
00:32:04,844 --> 00:32:07,944
Or I can stay up with you,

318
00:32:08,644 --> 00:32:09,664
keep you company.

319
00:32:12,124 --> 00:32:17,864
No, I don't want to be
a burden or whatever.

320
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:22,664
Sure

321
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:30,112
But seriously, if you do get
freaked out or something,

322
00:32:30,168 --> 00:32:34,884
just wake me up. It's not nice being
scared alone.

323
00:32:38,664 --> 00:32:40,259
Thanks, Joe.

324
00:32:40,283 --> 00:32:45,424
You better

325
00:34:11,244 --> 00:34:14,544
Get ready to move out of here.

326
00:34:18,084 --> 00:34:19,464
Fuck smoke.

327
00:35:16,754 --> 00:35:17,754
Hang in.

328
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:22,974
Give me that.

329
00:39:30,724 --> 00:39:32,504
What a fucking rush.

330
00:40:01,424 --> 00:40:04,024
- Yes, ma'am.
- Id's?

331
00:40:10,044 --> 00:40:11,839
Okay. Are you staying the night?

332
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:14,528
Yeah, just one

333
00:40:14,552 --> 00:40:16,379
Park over there.

334
00:40:16,403 --> 00:40:18,340
There's a canteen where you can eat

335
00:40:18,364 --> 00:40:20,117
and no tents available.

336
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:21,384
Thanks, maam.

337
00:41:24,324 --> 00:41:25,324
Yeah.

338
00:41:54,224 --> 00:41:56,524
- I brought you something. - Thanks.

339
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,324
- Don't forget to eat.
- I'm starving.

340
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,307
Eat.
Once I'm done with this

341
00:42:09,331 --> 00:42:11,839
Developing right on the road.

342
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,964
Yeah,
I got myself a pretty neat travel kit.

343
00:42:15,564 --> 00:42:16,564
I'm impressed.

344
00:42:16,571 --> 00:42:18,860
Want to know the secret of getting

345
00:42:18,892 --> 00:42:20,264
the developer just right?

346
00:42:23,604 --> 00:42:25,119
Body temperature.

347
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:26,824
- Smart.
- Thank you.

348
00:42:31,804 --> 00:42:35,148
So, how about you tell me the story of

349
00:42:35,196 --> 00:42:36,866
how you became photojournalists?

350
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,715
You don't know.

351
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:41,264
I thought I was one of your heroes.

352
00:42:43,134 --> 00:42:44,889
Yeah, I do.

353
00:42:45,913 --> 00:42:47,214
When you were in college,

354
00:42:47,238 --> 00:42:53,094
you took the motherfucking
legendary photo of the antifa massacre.

355
00:42:53,214 --> 00:42:57,460
Then you became the youngest
ever Madden photographer.

356
00:42:57,484 --> 00:43:01,455
That would be my Wikipedia page.

357
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:02,874
But what's missing from it?

358
00:43:02,898 --> 00:43:06,074
I don't know, Cloud.

359
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,888
Well, that's gotta sit
here for ten minutes,

360
00:43:10,912 --> 00:43:12,726
so you might as well expand
a little.

361
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,854
What about your folks?

362
00:43:16,354 --> 00:43:19,218
Well, actually, they're on a farm too.

363
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:24,348
Oh, except Colorado. Also pretending
this isn't happening.

364
00:43:24,372 --> 00:43:26,054
No shit.

365
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:33,454
Hey, these are dry.
Should we check them out?

366
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:34,677
Sure.

367
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:37,634
Still need a phone even
though you can't get a signal.

368
00:43:48,054 --> 00:43:49,201
I don't want you to see these.

369
00:43:49,225 --> 00:43:52,574
Um, they're not even in focus.

370
00:43:52,598 --> 00:43:55,182
Like exposure's all wrong.

371
00:43:55,318 --> 00:44:01,174
Keep looking. I figure the strike
rate for keepers is 30 to one.

372
00:44:26,614 --> 00:44:29,154
It's a great photo, Jesse.

373
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:48,414
Did we just drive through a time portal?

374
00:46:49,234 --> 00:46:50,894
It's a twilight zone.

375
00:47:19,974 --> 00:47:23,634
Hey there. Welcome.
Feel free to look around.

376
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:41,374
Hey, out of interest,

377
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:46,714
are you guys aware
there's like a pretty huge

378
00:47:46,754 --> 00:47:49,374
civil war going on all across America?

379
00:47:49,754 --> 00:47:53,394
Oh, sure, but we just try to stay out.

380
00:47:58,214 --> 00:47:59,008
Stay out?

381
00:47:59,032 --> 00:48:02,674
with what we see on the
news. Seems like it's for the best.

382
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:06,123
Yeah,

383
00:48:06,147 --> 00:48:09,034
well, let me know if you
want to try anything on

384
00:48:12,734 --> 00:48:13,554
Lee.

385
00:48:18,194 --> 00:48:19,279
What?

386
00:48:19,303 --> 00:48:22,094
You're so war torn
you can't try on a dress?

387
00:48:38,954 --> 00:48:42,754
Jesus, you haven't seen yourself

388
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:43,687
in a mirror?

389
00:48:43,711 --> 00:48:44,576
Oh my God, you didn't.

390
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,974
Shut the fuck up.

391
00:48:46,914 --> 00:48:48,734
Turn around. I want to take your photo.

392
00:48:51,314 --> 00:48:54,614
No. Come on.

393
00:48:55,314 --> 00:48:56,094
Yes,

394
00:49:11,614 --> 00:49:12,771
you're gonna take the photo.

395
00:49:12,795 --> 00:49:15,006
Tell me not to rush.

396
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,560
Yeah, but there's a sweet
spot and you're missing it.

397
00:49:17,584 --> 00:49:19,797
Don't wanna
miss your sweet spot.

398
00:49:19,821 --> 00:49:24,194
Well, no,
that was not the moment.

399
00:49:26,134 --> 00:49:35,378
Okay, one more.

400
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:36,511
Yes.

401
00:49:36,535 --> 00:49:38,054
You're pretty when you smile.

402
00:49:40,874 --> 00:49:43,894
- There you go.
- Hey,

403
00:49:46,554 --> 00:49:50,574
- how about this?
- Yeah nice.

404
00:49:52,794 --> 00:49:53,987
Not gonna take a picture,

405
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:57,334
right? You know
what, though?

406
00:49:57,358 --> 00:49:59,174
Running a little long on film.

407
00:50:01,974 --> 00:50:04,434
You mean.
I'm out.

408
00:50:10,454 --> 00:50:11,834
I'm gonna try this on.

409
00:50:26,194 --> 00:50:27,894
You actually bought something?

410
00:50:31,034 --> 00:50:33,494
She did. It's paid now.

411
00:50:37,194 --> 00:50:41,553
It's so weird. This place is
like everything I've forgotten.

412
00:50:41,577 --> 00:50:44,666
Funny, I was thinking it

413
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,734
felt like everything I remembered.

414
00:50:48,794 --> 00:50:51,934
Look at the tops of the buildings.
Be subtle.

415
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,104
Wouldn't have suited us anyway, Lee.

416
00:51:11,044 --> 00:51:12,464
We'd have gotten bored.

417
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:17,294
I remain ready to accept the full,

418
00:51:17,444 --> 00:51:21,202
immediate and unconditional surrender
of the secessionist

419
00:51:21,258 --> 00:51:25,130
angels to liberate
the people of the subjugated

420
00:51:25,202 --> 00:51:28,814
states and start rebuilding
our greek nation.

421
00:51:31,194 --> 00:51:32,852
Words might as well be random.

422
00:51:32,876 --> 00:51:37,014
What do you think he'll actually
say if I do get a mic in front of me?

423
00:51:37,038 --> 00:51:42,902
Not much the ones that get taken.
Gaddafi, Mussolini, Ceausescu.

424
00:51:42,926 --> 00:51:45,444
There are always lesser men than you think.

425
00:51:45,468 --> 00:51:47,630
At the end.
He'll let you down, Joe.

426
00:51:47,654 --> 00:51:50,354
As long as he isn't
dead before I get there.

427
00:52:02,628 --> 00:52:04,054
Hold up.

428
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:34,602
It was a turn off three or 4 miles back.

429
00:52:34,626 --> 00:52:36,702
Maybe we should turn
around and take another route.

430
00:52:36,726 --> 00:52:38,404
Can you see anything?

431
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:44,164
Nothing. No shapes, no movement, nothing?

432
00:52:45,384 --> 00:52:46,424
No.

433
00:52:48,984 --> 00:52:51,244
Okay, I'm gonna drive forward a little.

434
00:53:17,709 --> 00:53:19,709
Should we keep going?

435
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:22,233
Shit!

436
00:53:41,934 --> 00:53:43,127
Where you going?

437
00:53:43,151 --> 00:53:44,444
Them.

438
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:46,573
Don't be such a hot shot.

439
00:53:47,897 --> 00:53:49,874
Just keep your head down.

440
00:53:49,898 --> 00:53:50,898
No, shit.

441
00:54:02,994 --> 00:54:04,645
Let me try driving on.

442
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:07,174
This guy's a good shot.

443
00:54:35,534 --> 00:54:38,910
Hey, what's going on?

444
00:54:39,102 --> 00:54:40,514
Someone in that house.

445
00:54:42,414 --> 00:54:45,974
They're stuck.
We're stuck.

446
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:48,174
Who do you think they are?

447
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,014
No idea.

448
00:54:55,954 --> 00:54:58,854
Hey. We're press.

449
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:02,674
Cool.

450
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:07,254
Now I understand why it's
written on the side of your vehicle.

451
00:55:16,254 --> 00:55:18,674
Are you WF?
Who's giving you orders?

452
00:55:20,134 --> 00:55:22,074
No one's giving us orders, man.

453
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:25,724
Someone's trying to kill us.

454
00:55:25,748 --> 00:55:27,574
We are trying to kill them.

455
00:55:29,498 --> 00:55:31,596
You don't know what side
they are fighting for.

456
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,714
Oh, I get it.

457
00:55:34,734 --> 00:55:35,946
You're retarded.

458
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:40,594
You don't understand a word
I say.

459
00:55:42,274 --> 00:55:45,014
Yo, what's over there in that house?

460
00:55:48,634 --> 00:55:49,974
Someone shooting.

461
00:55:53,514 --> 00:55:57,574
Guys, shut the fuck up.

462
00:56:30,004 --> 00:56:31,384
I got good news.

463
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:09,314
Why don't you put your head down there?

464
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:11,867
I think so... I'm good.

465
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:15,658
Take it from an overhand
sleep any chance you get.

466
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,644
You never know what's
coming around the next corner.

467
00:58:05,824 --> 00:58:07,914
- Sammy. 
- What?

468
00:58:07,938 --> 00:58:10,124
Got a car coming up on us
pretty fast.

469
00:58:14,864 --> 00:58:17,466
What do you think?
- I don't know.

470
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:18,764
Maybe they're just in a hurry.

471
00:58:24,864 --> 00:58:26,415
Oh, they're in a hurry, all right.

472
00:58:26,439 --> 00:58:30,396
He smoked his tires
on the last one.

473
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,420
Okay,

474
00:58:31,784 --> 00:58:34,035
well, we're not gonna
outrun anyone in this thing,

475
00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:37,046
So, slow down a little, Lee. Let him pass.

476
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:38,864
Roger that.

477
00:58:52,164 --> 00:58:56,104
Don't look out at them.
They just rolled on by.

478
00:59:13,064 --> 00:59:15,764
What the fuck?
Tony.

479
00:59:16,784 --> 00:59:20,456
- What the fuck?
- How you guys doing?

480
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,938
You just scared the shit out of me.

481
00:59:21,962 --> 00:59:24,064
Good.
That was the idea.

482
00:59:24,224 --> 00:59:26,125
What the fuck are you doing here?

483
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:28,836
I don't know, dude.
What are you doing here?

484
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:32,074
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

485
00:59:33,774 --> 00:59:35,291
God.
Small world.

486
00:59:35,315 --> 00:59:37,766
Small world, my ass.
They were following us.

487
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:40,027
Did you tell them where we
were headed back in New York?

488
00:59:40,051 --> 00:59:41,234
Fuck no.

489
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:45,270
Hey, Tony, did Joe tell you where
we were going back in New York?

490
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:46,510
I don't know, Lee.

491
00:59:46,734 --> 00:59:50,594
He was pretty drunk when he was hitting
on that girl you got in the back seat.

492
00:59:52,614 --> 00:59:53,614
You're a dick.

493
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:55,392
What can must have been so wasted.

494
00:59:55,448 --> 00:59:58,084
Lee, I'm done with Bohai.

495
00:59:58,504 --> 01:00:01,044
He loves the company.
He drives like a maniac.

496
01:00:02,384 --> 01:00:03,444
Shoot your mom,

497
01:00:06,344 --> 01:00:08,564
- Dude, what are you doing?
- I tell you.

498
01:00:11,424 --> 01:00:13,404
Are you fucking crazy. Tony,

499
01:00:17,544 --> 01:00:18,564
Don't worry.

500
01:00:35,884 --> 01:00:37,666
I gotta do it. 
- What?

501
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:39,132
I'm doing it.

502
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,904
Jesus, Lee, don't turn the wheel.

503
01:00:45,884 --> 01:00:49,184
My new passenger.
Much better. Much better.

504
01:00:51,044 --> 01:00:53,044
Bye-bye.
See you in Washington.

505
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,544
I told you, he drives like a maniac.

506
01:01:18,064 --> 01:01:19,284
Where did they go?

507
01:01:29,864 --> 01:01:31,648
This feels funny.

508
01:01:31,672 --> 01:01:33,524
Where'd your guy go, Tony?

509
01:01:34,544 --> 01:01:36,227
He's just fucking around, that's all.

510
01:01:36,251 --> 01:01:37,774
I don't want him fucking around.

511
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:39,339
I want Jesse back in this car.

512
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:42,718
Relax, please. Look how fast
you can drive. The girl's fine.

513
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:45,274
How the fuck do you know
if she fine. Can you see them?

514
01:01:46,098 --> 01:01:47,098
Oh.

515
01:04:19,384 --> 01:04:21,355
We need to go down there now.

516
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:23,580
If we go down there,
they're going to kill us.

517
01:04:23,604 --> 01:04:26,668
No, those aren't government forces.

518
01:04:26,692 --> 01:04:29,336
Not up here.
Could have trespasses.

519
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,226
We're cool.

520
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:33,538
Those people do not want to
be seen doing what they're doing.

521
01:04:35,462 --> 01:04:36,462
Tell us, Lee.

522
01:04:39,594 --> 01:04:40,528
they're talking.

523
01:04:40,552 --> 01:04:42,010
They're just giving them a scare.

524
01:04:42,034 --> 01:04:43,946
They killed all the people
in that fucking truck.

525
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,147
They could have killed the
whole town.

526
01:04:45,171 --> 01:04:46,171
But they'll stop now.

527
01:04:46,172 --> 01:04:47,337
Who knows where those bodies are from?

528
01:04:47,361 --> 01:04:50,076
Other bodies in uniform?

529
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,884
No, they're not.

530
01:04:54,664 --> 01:04:56,273
- I'm going down.
- I'm coming with you.

531
01:04:56,297 --> 01:04:56,929
Me too.

532
01:04:56,953 --> 01:05:01,276
I'm telling you, every instinct and he
says, this is death. Okay? Death.

533
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,404
You stay.

534
01:05:02,704 --> 01:05:04,924
You stay.
Cause you're old, you can't run.

535
01:05:05,744 --> 01:05:09,284
Fuck it. Shit.
Fuck this.

536
01:05:29,724 --> 01:05:31,584
Why?
There's one hung up in there.

537
01:05:36,864 --> 01:05:39,724
Hey. Hey, guys.

538
01:05:44,944 --> 01:05:46,164
What's happening?

539
01:05:50,704 --> 01:05:54,000
I guess there's some kind
of misunderstanding here.

540
01:05:54,112 --> 01:05:55,883
Yeah? 
- Yes, sir.

541
01:05:56,807 --> 01:05:59,804
Those two guys over there,
they're my colleagues.

542
01:06:06,724 --> 01:06:09,196
- What kind of colleagues?
- Journalist, Sir.

543
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,724
Were you actually just...
we were passing through.

544
01:06:13,884 --> 01:06:16,504
- Passing through where? - Charlottesville.

545
01:06:16,844 --> 01:06:18,024
Charlottesville?

546
01:06:21,924 --> 01:06:25,584
- What's in Charlottesville? - Good hiking.

547
01:06:25,964 --> 01:06:26,964
Are you?

548
01:06:31,734 --> 01:06:32,734
Actually, we are.

549
01:06:32,912 --> 01:06:35,627
No, we are covering the university campus
there.

550
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:39,540
They started a new program,
they are reopening the school,

551
01:06:39,564 --> 01:06:43,314
which is a surreal feel good stuff.

552
01:06:45,414 --> 01:06:47,554
I guess we all need that, right?

553
01:06:55,794 --> 01:06:56,794
Yeah.

554
01:07:00,554 --> 01:07:01,753
This guy's your calling?

555
01:07:02,577 --> 01:07:04,922
- This guy here? 
- Yes. Excuse me.

556
01:07:06,778 --> 01:07:10,254
That guy.

557
01:07:20,054 --> 01:07:21,054
Sir,

558
01:07:23,774 --> 01:07:26,114
- Just... 
- Just what?

559
01:07:27,574 --> 01:07:28,765
Just what?
- You know what.

560
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:29,902
- What? 
- Just please.

561
01:07:29,926 --> 01:07:30,926
Just please,

562
01:07:31,254 --> 01:07:33,928
Sir. Please. 
- Yes, just speak.

563
01:07:33,952 --> 01:07:35,318
We're american journalists.

564
01:07:35,446 --> 01:07:36,634
You told me that already.

565
01:07:36,658 --> 01:07:40,394
Okay, We-We work for Reuters.

566
01:07:40,518 --> 01:07:42,614
Reuters doesn't sound american.

567
01:07:42,854 --> 01:07:44,268
It's a news agency.

568
01:07:44,292 --> 01:07:45,742
I know what Reuters is,

569
01:07:45,798 --> 01:07:47,651
Sir. 
Okay, I'm just saying.

570
01:07:47,675 --> 01:07:49,366
- Just saying just what?
- We're american.

571
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:50,370
Okay?

572
01:07:52,574 --> 01:07:55,514
Okay. What kind of american are you?

573
01:07:59,614 --> 01:08:01,554
Central American.
South american?

574
01:08:08,894 --> 01:08:09,894
What?

575
01:08:12,394 --> 01:08:14,814
- Florida? 
- Florida.

576
01:08:16,794 --> 01:08:17,794
Central.

577
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,134
What about you?
Where are you from?

578
01:08:34,554 --> 01:08:35,814
Tell him, Jesse.

579
01:08:39,214 --> 01:08:41,474
- Missouri. 
- Missouri.

580
01:08:44,014 --> 01:08:47,630
- It's Missouri state, right? 
- Yes.

581
01:08:47,742 --> 01:08:50,790
- You know what they call it? 
- Yes.

582
01:08:50,982 --> 01:08:52,754
Why they call it Missouri state?

583
01:08:55,214 --> 01:09:03,094
- I don't know. 
- You don't know?

584
01:09:03,134 --> 01:09:06,594
It's american. 
It is american. 100%.

585
01:09:11,874 --> 01:09:13,334
What about you?
Where are you from?

586
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:18,254
- Colorado. 
- Colorado.

587
01:09:20,514 --> 01:09:22,374
Colorado. 
Missouri.

588
01:09:25,434 --> 01:09:28,514
That's what I'm talking about. 
America.

589
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:40,422
Who's this guy hiding over here?

590
01:09:40,446 --> 01:09:44,454
Hey, buddy.
What's your deal?

591
01:09:44,494 --> 01:09:45,494
Where are you from?

592
01:09:47,534 --> 01:09:49,914
Huh? Where are you from?

593
01:09:53,124 --> 01:09:54,704
Can't speak.
Are you mute?

594
01:09:58,004 --> 01:10:00,064
You can't speak English?

595
01:10:01,644 --> 01:10:05,264
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can. Okay.

596
01:10:09,404 --> 01:10:11,991
Open your mouth and
tell me where you're from.

597
01:10:12,015 --> 01:10:15,224
Just make sure it's clear
fucking English. Okay.

598
01:10:17,324 --> 01:10:21,684
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Hong Kong.

599
01:10:22,584 --> 01:10:23,644
Oh. China.

600
01:10:25,904 --> 01:10:26,904
China.

601
01:10:30,984 --> 01:10:32,712
Just stop it, okay?

602
01:10:32,736 --> 01:10:34,616
Who the fuck.

603
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,680
Stop it.

604
01:10:48,714 --> 01:10:52,094
Get in the car.
Get in the fucking car.

605
01:12:35,704 --> 01:12:36,725
Gotta stop.

606
01:12:36,749 --> 01:12:39,400
- What are you talking about?
- I can't drive.

607
01:12:39,592 --> 01:12:41,388
We can't stop.
We gotta fucking drive.

608
01:12:41,412 --> 01:12:42,412
I can't.

609
01:12:42,472 --> 01:12:45,364
He's been hit. 
He's bleeding.

610
01:12:45,864 --> 01:12:48,844
No, no, no, no. Fuck.

611
01:12:52,304 --> 01:12:54,204
Okay, get up. Get up.

612
01:17:20,524 --> 01:17:23,164
We just heard about Sammy.
And there are two guys.

613
01:17:23,244 --> 01:17:26,060
Tony, Bohai.
Their names.

614
01:17:26,132 --> 01:17:28,944
Lee. I'm really sorry.
I know what he was to you.

615
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:32,164
- They're so fucked up.
- Oh, it's so fucked up.

616
01:17:32,324 --> 01:17:33,573
It's so fucked up.

617
01:17:33,597 --> 01:17:38,199
Now you wait until you hear
what these two have to say.

618
01:17:38,223 --> 01:17:40,551
Joe, I'm just trying to talk,
to leave out Sammy.

619
01:17:40,575 --> 01:17:43,220
I know. Yeah, I heard. Your
condolences means a lot.

620
01:17:43,244 --> 01:17:45,617
Now just, just tell her

621
01:17:46,741 --> 01:17:48,989
We loved Sammy. 
Everyone did.

622
01:17:50,413 --> 01:17:52,716
Thank you, Anya. 
- Fuck.

623
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,054
The western forces are moving into DC.

624
01:17:55,078 --> 01:17:59,204
Earlier today, the government
military basically surrendered.

625
01:18:01,744 --> 01:18:03,878
Yeah, it's true.

626
01:18:04,602 --> 01:18:06,120
DC's only protection now.

627
01:18:06,143 --> 01:18:07,763
A few do or
die soldiers.

628
01:18:07,787 --> 01:18:08,781
Handful of Secret Service.

629
01:18:08,805 --> 01:18:10,728
WF's gonna roll right in.

630
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:13,460
So you and I, we're too late.

631
01:18:13,512 --> 01:18:14,512
We missed the story.

632
01:18:14,735 --> 01:18:18,504
And Sammy didn't even die
for anything good.

633
01:18:57,344 --> 01:18:58,364
Bristol?

634
01:18:59,424 --> 01:19:00,604
Processing.

635
01:19:05,744 --> 01:19:06,744
Me too.

636
01:19:16,504 --> 01:19:18,631
Hardly knew Sammy compared to you.

637
01:19:18,655 --> 01:19:20,114
But yeah...

638
01:19:20,154 --> 01:19:23,734
You knew the man you were with.

639
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:25,854
That's who he was.

640
01:19:31,114 --> 01:19:32,695
It may sound fucked up,

641
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:39,199
But there are so many ways that it could
have ended for him.

642
01:19:39,223 --> 01:19:42,479
And a lot of them were worse.

643
01:19:42,503 --> 01:19:45,194
He didn't want to quit.

644
01:19:51,134 --> 01:19:52,714
These last few days,

645
01:19:54,214 --> 01:19:56,514
I've never been scared like that before.

646
01:19:58,414 --> 01:20:00,874
And I've never felt more alive.

647
01:28:39,644 --> 01:28:41,424
Get over here, now.

648
01:29:08,519 --> 01:29:10,519
Oh my god.

649
01:29:10,544 --> 01:29:11,924
So fucking close.

650
01:29:15,744 --> 01:29:18,532
Western forces have reached
the White House perimeter.

651
01:29:18,556 --> 01:29:21,008
The president is now surrounded.

652
01:29:21,032 --> 01:29:22,032
We have...

653
01:29:26,884 --> 01:29:28,785
Just give me a minute.
We're gonna have to go again.

654
01:29:28,809 --> 01:29:32,984
You give him good
shit, leave on their. Boyle,

655
01:29:33,604 --> 01:29:34,376
you

656
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:38,323
wf propelling out of a chopper
under the roof of the fucking Pentagon.

657
01:29:38,347 --> 01:29:40,634
There's really only one shot though, huh?

658
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:42,999
You know who's in there?

659
01:29:43,023 --> 01:29:45,837
They got intel from the generals
that surrendered yesterday.

660
01:29:45,861 --> 01:29:48,312
The president's right
in that fucking building.

661
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:52,908
What do you hear they're
gonna do with him?

662
01:29:52,932 --> 01:29:53,932
Kill?

663
01:29:54,774 --> 01:29:55,774
No, capture.

664
01:29:55,909 --> 01:29:58,714
Whoever gets a fucking gun.
Always had first.

665
01:30:00,214 --> 01:30:04,914
Hey, Lee. Don't beat me to
the money side, huh?

666
01:30:09,794 --> 01:30:12,414
Got the beast, two suburbans,
right outside.

667
01:30:13,854 --> 01:30:17,334
President's on the move.
Fuck yeah.

668
01:30:17,374 --> 01:30:19,374
He's busting out.

669
01:31:18,816 --> 01:31:21,644
by western forces as
if attempted to escape.

670
01:31:25,644 --> 01:31:26,944
He's not in there.

671
01:31:30,844 --> 01:31:32,064
He's not in there.

672
01:31:33,964 --> 01:31:34,964
What?

673
01:31:36,784 --> 01:31:40,024
Okay, let's go, let's go.

674
01:31:40,064 --> 01:31:41,977
- What do you mean?
- Jesse, come on, now.

675
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Pull me the moving out it.

676
01:33:08,994 --> 01:33:10,454
This place is empty.

677
01:33:20,734 --> 01:33:22,554
Stay the fuck out of our way.

678
01:33:44,954 --> 01:33:47,334
I believe you're fire.

679
01:33:48,674 --> 01:33:49,694
I'm alone.

680
01:33:53,474 --> 01:33:56,054
Standing in the middle of
the touch briefing room.

681
01:34:02,594 --> 01:34:03,814
I'm here to talk.

682
01:34:05,114 --> 01:34:06,114
Flooded.

683
01:34:15,214 --> 01:34:17,714
I'm here to negotiate the
surrender of the president.

684
01:34:18,934 --> 01:34:19,986
He's here.

685
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:22,020
You the WF?

686
01:34:22,044 --> 01:34:23,954
Take a wild guess.

687
01:34:23,978 --> 01:34:27,266
Can the president be
entrusted into your safe care?

688
01:34:27,290 --> 01:34:30,215
Yes, ma'am. We'll take
real good care of him.

689
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:31,139
Just bring him out here.

690
01:34:31,221 --> 01:34:33,392
We're not bringing him anywhere
until we have agreed terms.

691
01:34:33,416 --> 01:34:35,940
We need a guarantee of
safe passage for the president.

692
01:34:35,964 --> 01:34:38,097
And we need extraction
to a neutral territory.

693
01:34:38,121 --> 01:34:40,812
We request Greenland
or Alaska.

694
01:34:40,836 --> 01:34:43,254
Nah, no terms.

695
01:34:43,754 --> 01:34:44,605
Bring them out here.

696
01:34:44,629 --> 01:34:46,248
We gotta move. Sergeant.

697
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,910
Ma'am, the president is willing...

698
01:34:48,834 --> 01:34:51,494
Gunner, point.
Zack. Moving.

699
01:35:06,434 --> 01:35:07,434
Just go...

700
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:28,850
get back.

701
01:35:40,574 --> 01:35:43,154
I'm out. Reloading. Reloading.

702
01:35:52,374 --> 01:35:53,474
Crash it.

703
01:36:12,394 --> 01:36:13,934
Chief, clip left.

704
01:36:17,314 --> 01:36:18,976
The cross check.

705
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:20,300
Forward gunner,

706
01:36:21,402 --> 01:36:23,156
I'm moving across. I
need your legs to fire.

707
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,814
Sergeant, you're going left.

708
01:36:27,404 --> 01:36:29,971
Copy. Yo, ready?

709
01:36:29,995 --> 01:36:31,504
Move. Move.

710
01:36:50,964 --> 01:36:54,324
Good. Stay down.

711
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:04,594
Deacon, flag. Move. Stay.

712
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:07,204
Move up. Move.
Get him up. Moving.

713
01:37:09,624 --> 01:37:13,204
Ready. Break up.
Break up. Break up.

714
01:37:23,844 --> 01:37:25,514
Reload it.

715
01:37:25,538 --> 01:37:27,264
Perfect trash.

716
01:39:15,024 --> 01:39:16,024
Wait,

717
01:39:17,584 --> 01:39:18,584
wait.

718
01:39:29,324 --> 01:39:30,584
I need a quote.

719
01:39:31,569 --> 01:39:33,569
Don't, don't kill me.

720
01:39:37,644 --> 01:39:41,684
Yeah.
Don't do.
