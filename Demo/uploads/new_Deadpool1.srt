1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,015
[music]
(humming)

2
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,266
Ho ho ho, That logo music just

3
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,164
gets you pumped, right?
I'm sorry, I'm just excited to be here.

4
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,916
It's been a while.

5
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:48,983
You know for a long time, I
wasn't sure I'd ever be back.

6
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,952
Disney bought Fox, there was a whole

7
00:00:52,028 --> 00:00:54,700
boring rights issue,
blahpadee blahpadee blah.

8
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:56,359
But then, it turned out they wanted me?

9
00:00:56,772 --> 00:00:58,916
The one guy who shouldn't
even have his own movie.

10
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:01,975
Much less a franchise.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,229
Heh heh Marvel's so stupid.
Look, we know the title of this thing, so

12
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:07,783
I know what you're wondering.

13
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:09,479
How are we going to do this without
dishonoring Logan's memory?

14
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,704
And I'll tell you how.

15
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:14,791
We're not.
Only you

16
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:17,467
I'm going to let you

17
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:20,975
in on a little secret.
Wolverine is not dead.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,975
Sure, it made for a perfect

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,593
ending to a very sad story,
but that's not how

20
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:29,538
regenerative healing factors work.

21
00:01:29,563 --> 00:01:30,458
You think I want to be out here in
beautiful downtown North Dakota,

22
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:33,125
digging up the one and only Wolverine?

23
00:01:33,404 --> 00:01:37,052
No, thank you.
But the fate of my

24
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:38,162
entire world is at stake.

25
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,333
He may not be living his best life, but
he sure as hell ain't dead.

26
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:46,500
Bingo.

27
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:52,055
Yahtzee.
Ah yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

28
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,157
Damn it!

29
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,833
Son of a bitch!
Fuck! Motherfucker!

30
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:02,458
My world is fucked!

31
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:03,551
That was weird.
I'm much calmer now.

32
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,344
Look, I'm not a man of science,

33
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:11,333
but you seem incredibly passed away.
But it's good to see ya.

34
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:13,458
I gotta be honest, I've always wanted to

35
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:15,958
ride with you, Log.
You and me getting into it

36
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:19,000
Deadpool and a Wolverine.

37
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,416
Just fucking shit up.
Can you imagine the fun,

38
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:27,416
the chaos, the residuals?

39
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,830
Good day mate.
There's nothing that'll bring me back to

40
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:34,408
life faster than a

41
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:36,037
big bag of Marvel cash.
Me too, Hugh.

42
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:41,325
But no, no, no, no.

43
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,457
Ugh, he had to get all
noble and die for real.

44
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:47,823
God damn it!

45
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:50,365
I could really use your help right now.
Wait!

46
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,610
I'm warning you! I'm not alone!

47
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:57,433
Wade Winston Wilson!
You are under arrest by

48
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,410
the Time Variance Authority!

49
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:04,170
With too many crimes for this, come out!
God.. Oh...

50
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:15,698
death by day player.

51
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:17,735
Last chance!
Throw out your weapons

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,010
and come out peacefully!

53
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:23,135
I'm not gonna give you my weapons!
But I promise not to use them.

54
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:29,867
There are 206 bones in the human body.

55
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:30,772
207 if I'm watching Gossip Girl.
Here we go, maximum effort.

56
00:03:31,023 --> 00:03:33,443
Okay Peanut, guess we're getting

57
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:39,376
that team up after all.
I'm doing this tonight

58
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:42,075
You're probably gonna start a fight

59
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,566
I know this can't be right
Hey baby come on

60
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:45,986
I loved you endlessly

61
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:46,951
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave

62
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:55,527
And make it alone

63
00:03:55,592 --> 00:03:57,608
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie

64
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:07,131
I want to see you out that door

65
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,623
Baby bye bye bye
Don't want to be a fool for you

66
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:10,918
Just another player

67
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,750
in your game for two 
You may hate me 

68
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:47,515
but it ain't no lie

69
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:50,509
Baby bye bye bye
Bye bye

70
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:51,661
Don't really want to make it tough

71
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:53,306
I just want to tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy 

72
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,211
But it ain't no lie

73
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,395
Baby bye bye bye
You just hit me

74
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,301
with the truth, now

75
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:03,046
girl you're more than welcome to
Maradona, from outside the box!

76
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:14,934
GOAAALLLLLLLLLL!

77
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,639
Now baby come on
I know that I can't take no more

78
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:19,475
It ain't no lie

79
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:21,284
I want to see you out that door
Baby bye bye bye

80
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:24,398
Bye bye

81
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:29,148
Don't want to be a fool for you
Just another player

82
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:32,751
in your game for two

83
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:34,987
You may hate me 
but it ain't no lie

84
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:35,912
Baby bye bye bye

85
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:39,593
Don't really want to make it tough
I just want to tell you

86
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,245
that I've had enough

87
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:45,624
Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby 

88
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:47,063
bye bye bye

89
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:48,047
I don't wanna be your fool
In this game for two

90
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:49,243
So I'm leaving 

91
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,192
you behind
I don't want to make it tough

92
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:53,616
But I've had enough

93
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,784
Oh baby
Don't want to be  a fool for you

94
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,129
Just another player 

95
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:59,367
in your game for two
I don't want to be your fool

96
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:02,369
But it ain't no lie

97
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:06,834
Baby bye 
bye bye

98
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,463
Don't really want to make it tough

99
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:13,554
I just want to tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy

100
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:15,414
But it ain't no lie

101
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,202
Bye bye bye bye
(Metal claws coming out)

102
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:19,874
I am soaking wet right now.

103
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,882
(screaming) To be clear, I'm not
proud of any of this.

104
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:22,707
The waft of violence,

105
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:25,160
the whiff of necrophilia,
it isn't who I am, it

106
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:25,845
isn't who I wanna be.

107
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,770
Who I wanna be?
Well, to help you understand that,

108
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:32,624
I gotta take you back.

109
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:33,612
My little joy ride I
took through space and time,

110
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:34,168
to the day that changed everything.

111
00:08:34,193 --> 00:08:35,073
(dramatic music)
(gunshots)

112
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:36,111
I can't believe I'm finally here.

113
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:38,178
I've waited for this moment for so long.
Thank you, sir, for seeing me.

114
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,343
I firmly believe that my

115
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:40,668
services could be of great use
to your organization.

116
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:43,053
Now, I know I was caught smashsturbating

117
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:45,935
in the lobby of Stark Tower.
Smashturbating?

118
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,322
But I can assure you that.

119
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:51,127
I'm sorry, what was that?
No, I'm sorry.

120
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:55,126
That's when you get

121
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:57,548
those toy Hulk hands, right?
And then you just, you

122
00:08:57,573 --> 00:09:00,013
look down and you just,

123
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:03,989
you brace yourself and
you ravage the midsection.

124
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:06,007
I get it, okay, thank you.

125
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:07,562
The picture's painted.
You get the gist.

126
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:12,327
What exactly brings you here today?

127
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:13,890
Well I, wow okay, I care.
I know I turn

128
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:16,335
everything into a joke,

129
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,883
but I care and I want to use that feeling
for something important.

130
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:19,546
I want to matter.

131
00:09:21,632 --> 00:09:23,296
And to show my girl that I matter.
And, you know, I feel like I'm wasting

132
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:26,484
the good stuff here.

133
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:30,273
Is the man not going to be joining us?
The man?

134
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,730
Yeah, I should say this if he's going to.

135
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,611
As far as you can tell
right now, I'm the man.

136
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:38,410
The man is me.

137
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,024
I am the man in this circumstance.
And he doesn't do this

138
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:44,369
kind of thing anymore.

139
00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:50,171
Cameos?
Meetings.

140
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:53,937
Entry-level meetings.

141
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:57,022
Entry-level?
Aren't you the chauffeur?

142
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:58,109
I, maybe.

143
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,437
Common misconception,
I did begin my career

144
00:10:00,857 --> 00:10:02,600
as Mr. Stark's driver.

145
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,405
I quickly pivoted to
the head of security.

146
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,423
The head of security?

147
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,820
The head of security, of
course, yes, yes, yes, yes.

148
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:11,194
And why I am vetting your resume.

149
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:15,095
You seem to have left out whether or not
you had any experience

150
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:16,914
as a member of a team.

151
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:18,181
Could you maybe add a
little bit of perspective?

152
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:21,372
Oh, yes, of course.

153
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:24,248
I was Special Forces, but I was mainly,
I was team leader,

154
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,032
founder, really, of X-Force.

155
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:29,979
Sadly, they all perished in action.
How exactly did that happen?

156
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,467
Well, the police say

157
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:36,132
gravity, but just between us,
they didn't test well in the focus group.

158
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:38,711
Particularly Cable.

159
00:10:39,975 --> 00:10:41,308
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I
can see this isn't going on.

160
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:41,816
Please stop writing.

161
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,301
I'm just, I want to be an Avenger.
I want to be an Avenger.

162
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:44,302
Why do you want to be an Avenger?

163
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:48,604
Well look around you, I mean,
they're the best of the best.

164
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:50,946
And what they do matters.

165
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:53,119
I need to be an Avenger.
Sir, my girl has kinda had

166
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:57,149
it with my shtick,

167
00:10:57,849 --> 00:11:01,869
and if I don't, you
know, turn things around

168
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:05,755
and do something with my gifts,

169
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,374
I don't think it's going
to really work out for me,

170
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,440
and I wouldn't blame her.

171
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:13,828
Avengers are a very
unique group of superheroes

172
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:15,733
that stand for something

173
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:17,555
more than just fighting
and wearing costumes.

174
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:17,759
I mean, people look up

175
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:18,945
to us. Kids look up to us.
I'm sorry, us?

176
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,140
I wasn't aware that you were an Avenger.

177
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:28,875
Avengers adjacent, technically.
Oh, what's your

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,280
superpower? Is it parallel parking?

179
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:34,999
I am so sorry. That was cruel.
I lash out when I'm

180
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:42,361
nervous. It won't happen again.

181
00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:49,425
Let's cut to the chase. Please.
You just said moments ago

182
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,402
that you wanted to be an Avenger

183
00:11:52,427 --> 00:11:55,467
because you need it.
Yes, sir, I do.

184
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:58,301
But the Avengers don't do

185
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:00,512
the job because they need it.
They do the job because people need them.

186
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:02,591
Do you see the distinction?

187
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:05,163
Yes, sir.
Please, Mr. Hogan, I don't

188
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:09,560
want to spend the rest of my life

189
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:09,865
like an annoying one-trick pony.
All right.

190
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,370
Oh, my God. You're standing.

191
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:14,195
Yeah, now's the time that we stand.
Damn it.

192
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:17,698
The problem might be that

193
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:20,436
you're reaching a little too high.
Aim for the middle and you'll never miss.

194
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:23,201
Right? I think you got a good heart. I

195
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,648
believe what you're saying.
But not everybody's a world-saving type.

196
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:27,152
I'm not. I'm happy. Right?

197
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:30,155
I found my place.
Find your place.

198
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:32,688
All right. Get back out there.

199
00:12:32,713 --> 00:12:36,290
We'll keep an eye on you. Good luck.
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

200
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:40,154
Fetch the car. I want to hit Shake Shack.

201
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:41,787
Rejection makes me hungy.
No, no, no. Please.

202
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:45,193
No, no, no. Okay.

203
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:47,981
You know what they say?
When one door closes,

204
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:50,558
your locker at work opens.

205
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,349
Let's go sell some certified
pre-owned vehicles, motherf--

206
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:54,843
Technically, the

207
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:58,516
Carnival's not a minivan.
It's an MPV.

208
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:02,954
So how does the Kia

209
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:05,714
compare to the Honda Odyssey?
The Odyssey? That's a great question.

210
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:13,152
It doesn't fucking suck.

211
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:15,309
You know, you can answer
the question without swearing.

212
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:17,356
I'm sorry. Tammy I don't have kids.

213
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,376
Not that I haven't dreamt of that.
I don't have a lot of vaginal sex.

214
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:24,899
You'll get them next time, pal. Yeah.

215
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,741
And look, you can always
go back to super-heroing.

216
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,846
I mean, I know I'd like to

217
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:31,851
be back in the suit.
I don't keep it in my

218
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:33,445
locker so that I can wear it.

219
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,697
I keep it in my locker in
case we need to saddle up again.

220
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:36,742
Hey, hey, hey. What

221
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:37,507
is that doing in there?
I'm done.

222
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:38,454
I'm done.

223
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:38,759
Ane I'm fine with being done.
Look, is sales the best match?

224
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:39,364
Probably none.

225
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:40,361
Is this the life that I
always imagined for myself?

226
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,683
Fuck no!

227
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:45,784
This is the right fit for me.
Sugar Bear, it is. Okay, Mr. Wilson.

228
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:47,250
I'm just saying, once a month, we could

229
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:50,978
go on a little mission.
We're human beings. We crave purpose.

230
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:53,623
After all, we're Deadpool.

231
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:59,114
Please stop saying
that. We're not Deadpool.

232
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,962
I'm not even Deadpool anymore.

233
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:03,284
Well, if you're gonna have
a midlife crisis, go big.

234
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:10,729
A few years ago, a friend of

235
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:14,494
mine got his nipples pierced
with a titanium chain that goes down and

236
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,459
attaches to his Van Johnson.

237
00:14:15,717 --> 00:14:17,857
Are you feeling Grumple
Stiltskin because it's your birthday?

238
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:21,402
What?

239
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,464
No.
No.

240
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:28,741
Surprise!

241
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:30,867
All right, you guys
are lucky I'm not armed.

242
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:32,404
Get in here.

243
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:33,255
This was six years
ago. You'd all be dead.

244
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,316
So then, he gets out of the cab, and you

245
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:42,955
would not believe it.
I turn around, and what do I find?

246
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:43,908
Airpods. His Airpods!

247
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:44,961
Crazy stories. Every time.
Come on. Every single time.

248
00:14:44,986 --> 00:14:47,086
Make any sales today?

249
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:47,831
You know I didn't.
Did you sell any

250
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:50,212
dreamcatchers on Etsy or whatever it is that you do?

251
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:53,677
Our rent's due in three days Wade, and I
can't keep carrying it. Relax.

252
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:55,351
I have the money. I sold some old blood

253
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:57,636
pressure medication I found lying around.
You're trying to kill me, motherfucker.

254
00:14:57,661 --> 00:14:58,421
I'm not the one dousing

255
00:14:58,446 --> 00:14:59,166
everything in salt, motherfucker.
I pray every day that fire finds your

256
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:00,051
body and finishes the job

257
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:00,983
God didn't have the nuts to do.
That's hurtful. If you could hear the

258
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:03,047
look on my face,

259
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:04,192
you'd smell how sad I am.
You watching anything good?

260
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:06,437
Great British Bake-off.

261
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:08,873
Oh, God damn.
This shit stood between me

262
00:15:09,713 --> 00:15:10,283
and suicide for ten years.

263
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,912
Those are my feelings.
Abortion, religious freedom, animal

264
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:13,917
rights, privacy rights, vaccines, free

265
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:15,972
market capitalism, global climate change.
No, no, no, no speaking lines Buck.

266
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:16,739
Hi, Yukio. Hi, Wade.

267
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,388
Nice, fake o'clock shadow.
It's a summer balayage from the French.

268
00:15:18,606 --> 00:15:20,121
It's meant to mimic the natural

269
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,654
highlights of the sun.
It's a toupee. It's a hair system.

270
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:25,361
I love your hair system, Wade.

271
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:26,341
Thank you.
Want to do some cocaine? Hey, cocaine is

272
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,489
the one thing that

273
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:35,315
Feige said is off-limits.
What about Bolivian marching powder? They know

274
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:35,992
all the slang terms. They have a list.

275
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:37,199
Even snowboarding? Even disco dust.
White girl interrupted? Even Forrest Bump.

276
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:37,973
Focus shit. I wouldn't

277
00:15:37,998 --> 00:15:41,078
even try powdered gonuts.
Do you want to build a

278
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:43,063
snowman? Yes, but I can't.

279
00:15:47,186 --> 00:15:49,579
Pull here. Here?
What happened? That's the fun part.

280
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:53,709
Thanks for coming. Yeah.

281
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:56,040
How's work? Oh, I got a promotion.
No way. Yeah.

282
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,840
It's mind-numbing middle

283
00:15:57,865 --> 00:15:58,368
management, but I'm happy.
That's great.

284
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:03,711
You seeing anyone? How are you?

285
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:05,565
Um, yeah. A guy from work.
Dermot. Dermot?

286
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,370
He's kind. Good.

287
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:08,695
Likes to go hiking.
Hasn't gotten me shot yet.

288
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:11,867
Wow. It's the early days.

289
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:12,933
How about you? You seeing anyone?
No, no, I live in a one-bedroom

290
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,858
apartment. Share a bed with blind Al.

291
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:16,326
All right. All right.
Happy birthday to you.

292
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,631
Okay, okay, okay.

293
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:20,521
Birthdays.
Every spin around the moon

294
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:23,619
is a new adventure indeed.

295
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:24,705
Sun dumbass! Okay, round-earther.
Where was I? The Adventure of Life.

296
00:16:24,906 --> 00:16:25,731
Right. It's been a challenging few years.

297
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:27,610
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
Been through a lot. Change of life.

298
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:28,824
Menopause? Bitch, are you improv-ing?

299
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:30,993
I'm sorry that you had
to see that, Yukio.

300
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:31,906
But I'm happy.

301
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:33,146
You know, that's because of
each and every one of you.

302
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,396
I guess what I'm trying to say is how

303
00:16:35,914 --> 00:16:39,920
proud I am, how grateful I am,
to be standing in a room with every

304
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:44,783
single person I love.

305
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm the luckiest man alive.
Make a wish, buddy. 10-4, good buddy.

306
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,805
Going down.

307
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,586
Wade Wilson? Oh, yeah. Dancers.
Dopinder must have ordered you. Are

308
00:16:58,829 --> 00:16:59,939
those supposed to be cop costumes?

309
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:02,505
Never mind. Take your
clothes off, but leave the helmets.

310
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,474
And this isn't Pretty

311
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:10,292
Woman. We're kissing, all right?
What song do you guys normally dance to?

312
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:12,741
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

313
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,600
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is that supposed to be scary?

314
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,165
Pegging isn't new for me,

315
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:20,299
friendo, but it is for Disney.
Look, I've never been a natural bottom.

316
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:21,521
So we're going to take things real slow,

317
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:22,042
and I want some crazy eye contact.
Not you, you.

318
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,887
I can't see your eyes through

319
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,676
the mask, but I can feel it.
We're going to move on down the hallway

320
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:31,644
so we can spare a cleanup on aisle asshole.

321
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:32,948
How does everyone feel about this plan?
I don't like you. Yes.

322
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:36,871
Let's hold on to that attitude,

323
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:38,736
and we're going to do it angry.
[ominous music]

324
00:17:38,761 --> 00:17:40,942
Mr. Wilson.

325
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,366
You appear to have soiled
yourself while unconscious.

326
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:44,571
I wasn't unconscious. Who are you?

327
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,922
I go by the name of Paradox, Mr. Paradox,
and you're sitting here at the TVA, the

328
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:47,941
Time Variance Authority.

329
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,728
We're really a watchdog organization.
Except we're more

330
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:50,673
lighthearted than that sounds,

331
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:52,373
with sort of throwback ironic twist.
And we're in charge of defending what's

332
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,228
known as the sacred timeline.

333
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,639
Holy fuck, that is a shit ton of
exposition for a three-quel.

334
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:18,363
Is this because I used Cable's Time

335
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,076
Machine, brought a
couple of people back to life,

336
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,881
then I destroyed it.

337
00:18:22,906 --> 00:18:26,116
That was a long time ago.
Yes, we're aware of your

338
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:28,306
abuse of your timeline.

339
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,265
You were so abusive of it.
No, it has nothing to do

340
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,710
with that. Walk with me.

341
00:18:33,735 --> 00:18:36,795
I brought you here, Mr. Wilson, to tell
you that you're special.

342
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:42,074
In fact, you've been

343
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:45,349
chosen for a higher purpose,
a purpose unclear even to me,

344
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,234
but one that could save

345
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,759
the entire sacred timeline
from a possibly grizzly

346
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:51,088
fate sometime in the future,

347
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:54,093
which may very well need to be avenged.
This sacred timeline, I assume I'm going

348
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:56,655
to marvel at how cinematic it feels,

349
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,340
gratuitous cameos, indiscriminate use of
variants, the whole package.

350
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,111
No, you tell me.

351
00:19:05,981 --> 00:19:10,221
Cap.
You are no longer lost.

352
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:14,312
Wade.

353
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:16,137
You can be a hero among the heroes.
We've been surveilling

354
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:21,422
you for quite a while.

355
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:24,127
Subway station.
The TVA outpost, yes.

356
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:28,212
And what is that?

357
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:37,253
Is that me? Is that Thor?
Is he crying?

358
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:41,687
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

359
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,961
That happens in the distant future.
Why is Thor crying?

360
00:19:50,408 --> 00:19:51,254
Quick tell me. Do not speak to her. 

361
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:01,241
Stop that. Eyes on me, I brought you 
here to offer you an opportunity,

362
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,676
the opportunity you sought years ago but

363
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:06,542
for which you were not ready.
We believe you're ready now,

364
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:07,606
ready for a chance to leave your timeline

365
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:09,171
and join the greatest universe of all.
I am about to give you the

366
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,025
thing you've always wanted.

367
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:16,610
Oh I smell what you're stepping in.
The power of the Marvel

368
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,800
universe is about to change forever.

369
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:20,385
I am the Messiah.
I am...

370
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,548
Marvel Jesus.

371
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:24,589
Can you excuse me for just one-
I'm just gonna go over here

372
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:25,970
Suck it, Fox.

373
00:20:25,995 --> 00:20:28,178
I'm going to Disneyland.
Get fucked!

374
00:20:28,203 --> 00:20:31,648
Where do I sign?

375
00:20:31,673 --> 00:20:33,213
Oh, there's no need for paper work.
Good. Not to brag, but I do not read.

376
00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:35,441
There is one thing I will need, though.

377
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:38,099
Oh, fuck off.
Adorn me, Beardo.

378
00:20:38,124 --> 00:20:39,784
Fuckin' A!

379
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:41,149
It's perfect.
FYI, your tailor is a

380
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:44,346
predator, but I love it.

381
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:47,308
Snug, no camel toe, new
car smell, and adamantium.

382
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:54,787
Katanas, you shouldn't have.

383
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,160
Go ahead. Take it in.
And yes, your

384
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:02,754
underwear is getting tighter.

385
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:05,003
That guy knows what I'm talking about.
His clothes say middle management, but

386
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:06,447
his eyes say fucky fucky.

387
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,063
Yes, you look very nice.
Nice? Your buddy here is ready to throw

388
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:12,208
it all away from me.

389
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:13,536
You calling your wife?
HR.

390
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,125
Is your wife working HR?

391
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:17,794
I'm really glad
you're taking this so well.

392
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:23,867
Oh, I'm taking it well.

393
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:26,162
I have never had a
problem traveling for work.

394
00:21:46,935 --> 00:21:48,202
That said, we should talk vacation days.

395
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,121
I'm more of a one-week-on,
one-week-off kind of guy.

396
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:52,536
I think it's what they do in Denmark.

397
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,521
You'll never see a Danish
flag on the moon, but...

398
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:58,088
God damn it, they're happy.

399
00:21:58,581 --> 00:22:00,440
Now, let's power up your
little Amazon Fire Phone there

400
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:01,145
and zip me back home so

401
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,213
I can let my friends know
that they've been upgraded, to Disciples.

402
00:22:02,586 --> 00:22:05,225
Yep. I don't think that you quite understand.

403
00:22:05,387 --> 00:22:07,126
You will not be returning to your home
because there will be

404
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:11,714
no home to return to.

405
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,119
Come again, this time in my ears?
This is your universe, Mr. Wilson.

406
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,240
That, is what happens when a universe

407
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:17,416
loses their anchor being.
See how it decays from the inside?

408
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:19,256
This is how a reality dies.

409
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:21,341
What's an anchor being?
An anchor being is an

410
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:23,556
entity of such vital importance

411
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:26,102
that when they die, their whole world
slowly withers out of existence.

412
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:28,047
You've just won the

413
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:30,877
lottery because I didn't die.
It's just a little

414
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,317
midlife crisis, I'm better now.

415
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:35,942
Oh, my God!
Oh, not to laugh.

416
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:39,268
Can you imagine if you

417
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:43,628
were the anchor being?
Yeah.

418
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,433
No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.

419
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:51,801
Your anchor being died in
an act of self-sacrifice

420
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:53,821
so epic that it sent

421
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:00,888
shivers down the timeline.
I am referring, of

422
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:07,150
course, to Logan, the Wolverine.

423
00:23:07,175 --> 00:23:11,422
Don't be like me.
(Music)

424
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:12,335
Oh, this is what it feels like.

425
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,840
Logan.
Of course.

426
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:18,805
Logan.

427
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:22,280
Logan!
The guy with forks for hands!

428
00:23:22,305 --> 00:23:24,045
That Wolverine!

429
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:25,938
Yeah, I got it.
You can turn your retro

430
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:32,199
graphics of death off now.

431
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:33,473
Make it stop.
We're not doing it, Mr. Wilson. We

432
00:23:33,498 --> 00:23:35,978
certainly can't stop it.

433
00:23:36,104 --> 00:23:36,778
How long have we got?
In most cases, a couple thousand years.

434
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:40,385
Well, sweet.

435
00:23:41,147 --> 00:23:46,632
Most cases aren't
fast enough, not for me.

436
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:48,554
What does that mean?

437
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:51,079
It means that I have been tasked with
overseeing the end of your universe

438
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,311
and regardless of what the pencil pushers

439
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:56,324
upstairs would prefer,
I will not waste my life watching it die

440
00:24:00,263 --> 00:24:02,750
slowly of natural causes.

441
00:24:12,498 --> 00:24:15,311
We used to just prune these things,
simple, elegant, efficient,

442
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:17,841
but I'm told the TVA

443
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:19,655
doesn't like to do that anymore.
Well, I do.

444
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:21,301
And no matter what my

445
00:24:24,122 --> 00:24:25,342
so-called superiors say,
the multiverse does

446
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:27,315
not need a babysitter.

447
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:29,592
We need a mercy killer.
And in this instance,

448
00:24:30,408 --> 00:24:34,534
I am the mercy killer.

449
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,482
What in the macguffin is that?
That's a time-ripper for Mr. Wilson.

450
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:40,491
An accelerant.

451
00:24:40,516 --> 00:24:42,416
Once completed, it will allow me to
destroy the space-time

452
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:43,517
matrix of your universe.

453
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:46,002
You see, I don't want
to work for the TVA.

454
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:47,757
I want to be the TVA.

455
00:24:47,782 --> 00:24:52,542
And the first step involves showing this
organization how much more

456
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:55,305
efficient it can become to it.

457
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,416
I will be giving your universe a swift
and compassionate end.

458
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:03,819
And don't worry, your

459
00:25:03,844 --> 00:25:06,131
friends won't feel a thing.
It'll be over just like this.

460
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:08,736
Oh, what's that? Ugh!

461
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:11,261
Trust me.
You're gonna Old Yeller

462
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:13,026
my fucking universe?

463
00:25:13,051 --> 00:25:17,884
In your parlance, yes.
Two in the heart, one in the head.

464
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:24,434
Look, Mr. Wilson, you have two choices.

465
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:26,731
You can either rejoin your loved ones and
collectively cease to

466
00:25:26,756 --> 00:25:29,652
exist in, I'd say, 72 hours,

467
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:33,079
or you join the sacred timeline.
And you end your days of

468
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:35,264
insignificance and mediocrity.

469
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:37,509
Wade.
Wade, you can finally, finally matter.

470
00:25:37,722 --> 00:25:40,362
That's all I've ever really wanted.

471
00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:42,247
I know.
I know.

472
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:46,806
And you know, I'm nothing

473
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:48,435
if not morally flexible.
Hmm?

474
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,420
Yep, yep.

475
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:50,816
I'll do it.
Wise choice.

476
00:25:51,355 --> 00:25:52,155
Sacred timeline's happy to have you.

477
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:07,379
I was talking about finding the Wolverine
and breaking your fucking nose.

478
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:10,802
(Iris by Goo Goo Dolls plays)

479
00:26:11,295 --> 00:26:13,415
Find him.
Find him!

480
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,278
And boy, did he ever.

481
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:18,365
Which brings us back to this.
The desecration of the sacred corpse.

482
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,210
Ow, my own fucking arm.

483
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:26,901
[screaming]
Now we're talking! Agh my nads!  

484
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:27,946
Oh dear god!

485
00:26:28,562 --> 00:26:33,982
I'm sorry, Wolverining is hard!
Make it stop!

486
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:44,852
Mangle tried.

487
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:48,219
[screaming]
You sick fuck.

488
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:52,732
Logan was a hero and the only thing

489
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,133
worth a shit to
ever come out of Canada.

490
00:26:58,179 --> 00:26:59,059
[screaming]

491
00:26:59,106 --> 00:27:00,219
Get my country's name
out of your fucking mouth.

492
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:02,006
And my sword.

493
00:27:02,031 --> 00:27:03,771
Gimme that.
Oh, I gotta find me another Logan.

494
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:05,554
An alive one.

495
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:19,866
Don't get up, guys. I'll see myself out.
Logan!

496
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,212
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

497
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:23,505
Who's asking?
Well, look at this

498
00:27:24,606 --> 00:27:26,600
little hairy Lou Retton.

499
00:27:28,466 --> 00:27:30,994
Did you stick the landing little guy?
Yes, you did, comic-accurate short king.

500
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,093
Such a cute widdle, wolvie.

501
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:45,327
Cue the fucking montage, baby.
Ahoy, everything

502
00:27:45,352 --> 00:27:46,935
seems to be on fire.

503
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:48,368
Do you have a dragon?
Ooh, you have anchor

504
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:51,454
being written all over.

505
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:52,479
Patch.
Now we're talking.

506
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,054
Ooh, yeah.

507
00:27:56,629 --> 00:27:58,660
That's a whole
goddamn package right there.

508
00:27:58,685 --> 00:28:03,664
Howdie, I'm auditioning anchor beings.

509
00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:15,435
Oh, now that's gonna need some coconut oil.
What in the fuck?

510
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:17,042
Are you okay?

511
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:18,073
Oh, yes, yes.
Classic John Byrne brown in 10.

512
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:23,751
Now you fought the Hulk in

513
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:25,595
this outfit, no?
I'm Marvel Jesus, you dull

514
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,600
creature, and I want to--

515
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:36,143
It's not you. We're just going
in a different direction.

516
00:28:39,796 --> 00:28:41,737
You know, from behind, you

517
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:44,150
look a little bit like Henry--
Oh, my fuck.

518
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:48,209
The Cavillrine. The legends are true.

519
00:28:48,282 --> 00:28:49,948
And may I say, sir, on
behalf of all humanity,

520
00:28:49,973 --> 00:28:53,394
this just feels right.

521
00:28:53,462 --> 00:28:55,610
We will treat you so much better than
those shit-fucks down the street

522
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:58,055
You were just leaving.

523
00:28:58,183 --> 00:28:58,982
No, sir, not while the
fate of my universe is at--

524
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:01,308
This one looks promising.

525
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,713
Down you go.
Again.

526
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:05,827
I told you, you're not welcome here.

527
00:29:15,117 --> 00:29:16,704
You're not welcome anywhere.
Now get the fuck out of my bar.

528
00:29:18,354 --> 00:29:19,787
Just give me one more

529
00:29:20,797 --> 00:29:21,923
drink and then I'll leave.
That's not how it works.

530
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:24,376
It does now. Leave the bottle.

531
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:26,248
I know you, bub?
Nope. But I know you.

532
00:29:26,273 --> 00:29:28,988
Everybody knows me.

533
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:29,598
I'm the Wolverine.
Yes, you are, and I'm gonna need you to

534
00:29:30,052 --> 00:29:32,146
come with me right now.

535
00:29:35,266 --> 00:29:38,157
Look, lady, I'm not interested.
Really getting into your cups here--

536
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:39,744
Why would I go with you?

537
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:41,297
Because, unfortunately, I need you.
And even more unfortunately

538
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:43,544
my entire world needs you.

539
00:29:43,569 --> 00:29:45,866
You two gonna fuck or fight?
You gonna take that from him?

540
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:50,459
Yup.

541
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:04,019
I can tell you have a sort
of don't get too close,

542
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:09,105
I'll only break your heart vibe going here.

543
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,570
But every other Wolverine would have
really hurt me by now.

544
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:11,928
And I'm sort of on the tic-tic, so,

545
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:13,756
upsy-daisy, here we go.
Hey hey.

546
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:16,959
Whoa.

547
00:30:17,343 --> 00:30:18,943
Whiskey dick with the claws.
It's quite common in Wolverines over 40.

548
00:30:18,968 --> 00:30:21,907
You don't want this.

549
00:30:21,932 --> 00:30:23,092
You're right, I don't.
And you don't want this.

550
00:30:23,117 --> 00:30:23,697
Unless you want to take a deep breath

551
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:26,082
through your fucking forehead,
I suggest you reconsider.

552
00:30:29,949 --> 00:30:31,597
Let's go, Peanut.

553
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,997
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Hold on.
Watch this.

554
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:34,936
All right.

555
00:30:36,215 --> 00:30:38,439
That's whoa.  Easy.
Good God.

556
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:39,762
Thirsty little honey badger, aren't you?

557
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:41,467
It's okay. Keep going.
Audiences are

558
00:30:41,492 --> 00:30:43,512
accustomed to long run times.

559
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:45,356
I guess you'll have to do...
Okay.

560
00:30:45,922 --> 00:30:47,022
Ooh.

561
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:48,116
Look at those jammies.
That only took 20 fucking years.

562
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:49,126
One anchor being coming right up.

563
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:49,893
On your left, baby girl.
This Logan has the same... he can do

564
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:51,639
anything even musicals.

565
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,439
But, notice, he's
actually wearing a costume

566
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:56,022
like he's not embarrassed to be in a

567
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:57,887
superhero movie for once.
I don't understand.

568
00:30:57,912 --> 00:31:00,860
You said my universe is dying,

569
00:31:01,637 --> 00:31:03,233
because this sack of
nuts got himself killed.

570
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:04,547
Well, problem solved.

571
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,372
My God.
You actually think you can replace an

572
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,279
anchor being, with this!?

573
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:14,204
I wouldn't have accepted any other
Wolverine b-t-dubs,

574
00:31:14,797 --> 00:31:17,513
but you have outdone yourself and brought

575
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,021
me the worst Wolverine!
What do you mean the worst one?

576
00:31:23,697 --> 00:31:27,783
Mr. Wilson, this Wolverine

577
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:30,148
let down his entire world.
He's the stuff of

578
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:31,725
legend, but not in a good way.

579
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,512
And what he did... well, some things are
just beyond forgiveness.

580
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:34,821
Okay. How do I make this right?

581
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:36,901
I'll do anything.
I gave you a chance at greatness,

582
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:40,233
because my superiors

583
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:42,758
deemed you special.
Clearly not special in a good way,

584
00:31:42,783 --> 00:31:43,803
but apparently you have some important

585
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:44,968
future purpose to serve.
With Thor, he holds me.

586
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:48,186
But I did my duty.

587
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:49,831
I gave you the
opportunity to be somebody,

588
00:31:50,264 --> 00:31:51,610
and instead of accepting my offering with

589
00:31:55,857 --> 00:31:57,617
humility and gratitude,
you broke my nose.

590
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,572
Ah, It looks great.

591
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:00,957
and you decimated dozens of my men with the
exhumed corpse of a hero,

592
00:32:01,344 --> 00:32:02,873
dishonoring not only

593
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:04,173
his remains, but his memory.
What are you, the internet?

594
00:32:07,556 --> 00:32:08,610
Your world is dying!

595
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:11,393
Thank you very much.
And there's no stopping it.

596
00:32:12,176 --> 00:32:13,781
The humane thing to do is to make it quick.

597
00:32:13,884 --> 00:32:16,054
Is the thought of vaporizing
my universe making you peckish?

598
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,441
I'm eating my feelings.

599
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:24,789
I'm about to lose everything
that I've ever cared about,

600
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:28,672
because that hairy thundercunt from down

601
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:31,712
undercunt finally dies,
and he's standing

602
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:33,847
right behind me, isn't he?

603
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:36,695
Welcome to the MCU, by the way.
You're joining at a bit of a low point.

604
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,074
As for you, I want to talk to your boss.

605
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:40,674
I want you to get him on the phone,
and you tell him, her, or them

606
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:41,401
that Marvel H. Christ isn't playing.

607
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,859
Holy shit.
I just heard a symphony of buttholes

608
00:32:45,114 --> 00:32:46,385
clenching all at once.

609
00:32:46,493 --> 00:32:47,819
You're off-grid.
Your bosses don't know what you sick

610
00:32:47,844 --> 00:32:50,496
fucks are doing down here.

611
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:52,161
Well, I'll tell you what.
I have a black belt in Karen, and I'm

612
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:53,433
gonna go upstairs,

613
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:57,418
and I'm going to tell
them all about you and--

614
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:58,565
Oh, silence is nice. Isn't it.

615
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:02,343
Where the fuck did he go?
To the trash heap.

616
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:06,481
You'll fit right in.

617
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:07,626
That was close.  Ha ha!
Don't just stand there, you ape.

618
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:08,616
Give me a hand up.

619
00:33:08,926 --> 00:33:12,398
Nope, I'm actually okay. Thank you.
Where the hell are we?

620
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,313
I don't know.

621
00:33:15,338 --> 00:33:16,505
Looks kind of Mad Maxie.
But that would be IP infringement, right?

622
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,884
Fucking jokes.

623
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,717
Were you even listening back there?
We don't make it back to

624
00:33:23,993 --> 00:33:25,291
that Mr. Paradox asshole.

625
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:26,939
Everyone I know is going to die.
Not my fucking problem.

626
00:33:27,187 --> 00:33:30,199
Well, is that all you got?

627
00:33:30,224 --> 00:33:32,722
Is that what you said
when your world went to shit?

628
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:34,547
Come again?

629
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:37,401
Yeah, I heard all about you.
How you screwed up everything,

630
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:38,626
and you should be thanking me for pulling

631
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:40,702
you out of that bed you shit in.
Agh you backstabbing son of a bitch?

632
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,722
Are you ready to be calm now?

633
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:47,292
Rest in peace, you fucks.
I don't want to fight you, Peanut.

634
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,415
Doesn't matter what you did.

635
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,060
I just need your help.
I don't fucking care.

636
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:54,025
Fuck! This is gonna hurt.

637
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,270
Alright!
Fuck it!

638
00:33:55,295 --> 00:33:57,745
Let's give the people what they came for.

639
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,570
Let's fucking go.
Get your special sock out, nerds.

640
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:00,287
This gonna get good.

641
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:05,254
Baby knife
Let's see you grow

642
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,148
your fucking head back!

643
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,308
Wait wait wait, I can fix it! I can fix it!
Fix what? Whatever it is that you did.

644
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,353
Whatever made you so bad.

645
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:17,935
Those... those...
pricks In the TVA, you heard them.

646
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,998
They have the power to end my universe.

647
00:34:20,023 --> 00:34:22,429
But they also have the
power to change yours.

648
00:34:22,454 --> 00:34:24,434
We get back there.

649
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:27,791
And we can fix your world.
Together.

650
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,551
I promise.

651
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:36,377
They can fix it.
Hey!

652
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:41,010
We fight each other, we lose.

653
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:42,063
Dear God, it's him.
Who? The one.

654
00:34:42,088 --> 00:34:44,933
The superhero equivalent

655
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:45,738
to comfort food or Molly.
White guy's answer to all the

656
00:34:45,763 --> 00:34:50,623
disappointments at another A-lister.

657
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:53,963
Fair warning, gorgeous.
You're going to

658
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,286
encounter some delicate language.

659
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,184
A smidge of ass play, but we've been
prohibited from using cocaine, on camera.

660
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:57,697
They're coming.

661
00:35:00,205 --> 00:35:01,219
Who's they?
[engine revving]

662
00:35:22,614 --> 00:35:24,710
Oh, they're driving angry.

663
00:35:25,055 --> 00:35:26,215
Now that's a superhero landing!
I got this.

664
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,916
[engine revving]

665
00:35:32,294 --> 00:35:33,454
[engine revving]
Stay close.

666
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:36,099
Aye aye Captain.

667
00:35:36,124 --> 00:35:38,064
You got this.
Cassandra is going to be giddy when she

668
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:39,489
sees what we caught.

669
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,627
You can't run. Everybody knows that.
You see anyone running, dick for brains?

670
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,015
You're not going to love

671
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,726
what happens next.
Oh, oh my God.

672
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:50,092
Oh my God, oh my God he's gonna to say it. Ah fuck!

673
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:51,752
Ha! Oh my God, he's going to say it!
Say what?

674
00:35:51,981 --> 00:35:53,764
Avengers, assemb-

675
00:35:54,134 --> 00:35:57,001
Flame on! Sorry, what now?
[Fire whooshing]

676
00:35:58,527 --> 00:35:59,436
[screaming]

677
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:01,971
Oh, fuck!
[screaming]

678
00:36:02,115 --> 00:36:03,583
[crash]

679
00:36:03,608 --> 00:36:07,004
We don't know that guy.
We thought we did.

680
00:36:07,029 --> 00:36:09,289
I know you.

681
00:36:14,568 --> 00:36:16,528
Holy sh--
[growling]

682
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,095
Sabretooth, your brother.  Ready to die!?

683
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:42,181
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Time!
You look ridiculous.

684
00:36:43,215 --> 00:36:44,893
People have waited

685
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:46,975
decades for this fight.
It's not going to be easy.

686
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:49,547
Baby knife.

687
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:53,307
Shoot the double, take him down.
Side control, then full mount,

688
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:01,485
and you ground and pound till he makes

689
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:05,669
no sound because he's dead.
Shut the fuck up.

690
00:37:06,437 --> 00:37:07,477
Oh my God.

691
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,777
Okay, good luck. I'm a huge fan.
[foreboding tune]

692
00:37:10,991 --> 00:37:12,465
[laughing]

693
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:15,885
[growling]
What is it, girl?

694
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,175
Is there trouble at the well?

695
00:38:10,876 --> 00:38:11,649
[head drops]
[laughing]

696
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,367
Big trouble.

697
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:26,147
Behold!
The head of your precious queen, Furiosa!

698
00:38:26,172 --> 00:38:28,210
I have the Wolverine.

699
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:29,135
I alone control her.
You come for me!

700
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,937
You come for her.

701
00:38:30,962 --> 00:38:32,783
So sorry. I know it's pronounced him.
I'm genderblind. It's my cross to bear.

702
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:36,881
Who's next?

703
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,575
Toad!
You're up.

704
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,663
[metal clanging]

705
00:38:44,181 --> 00:38:47,344
[grunting]
Uh-oh.

706
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:48,824
Holy shi-

707
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:54,173
[crash]
Uh.

708
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:58,276
I should've...

709
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:00,917
God of Thunder.
(grunting)

710
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:02,376
How long was I asleep?

711
00:39:02,401 --> 00:39:04,961
Not all of you was asleep.
Don't bother.

712
00:39:04,986 --> 00:39:08,994
They're very thorough.

713
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:12,818
If you know where we are, start talking.
You're in the void.

714
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:17,069
Think of it as purgatory.

715
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:19,813
Reed called it a metaphysical junkyard
where anything useless goes

716
00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:27,476
before it gets annihilated

717
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:35,981
forever and where the TVA sends people
that don't play nice

718
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,484
with the rest of the multiverse.

719
00:40:07,145 --> 00:40:08,535
Like you?
And you.

720
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,912
What does the annihilating?

721
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:12,266
Alioth.
Alioth is in this thing?

722
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:18,153
From Loki season one episode five?

723
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:21,250
Everyone here is on the run from Alioth.
Oh, most don't make it.

724
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:23,823
There's a resistance though.

725
00:40:24,665 --> 00:40:26,833
Other people like us
that managed to survive,

726
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:27,958
they're hiding out in the borderlands

727
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:30,668
trying to find a way the fuck outta here.
Then that's where we go.

728
00:40:31,586 --> 00:40:33,429
We?

729
00:40:33,454 --> 00:40:34,093
Us?
A team?

730
00:40:34,118 --> 00:40:36,093
The answer is yes.

731
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:37,233
Shake on it.
Fuck!

732
00:40:59,952 --> 00:41:01,052
You nipped it.

733
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:06,621
Just got the tip with
your little steak knife.

734
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:07,922
These others can help

735
00:41:07,947 --> 00:41:09,427
us get back to the TVA.
They can fix things.

736
00:41:09,745 --> 00:41:11,173
(laughing)

737
00:41:13,165 --> 00:41:14,132
Something funny, bub?
She might have

738
00:41:15,003 --> 00:41:16,703
something to say about that.

739
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:18,143
Who's she?
In the void.

740
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:19,959
You're either food for a

741
00:41:20,032 --> 00:41:20,942
Alioth or you work for her.
(dramatic music)

742
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:23,595
(engine revving)

743
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,295
(dramatic music)
(dramatic music)

744
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,359
Heh, Paul Rudd finally aged.

745
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:28,066
Oh, you must be this year's Juggernaut.
Thank you.

746
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:29,811
I'd keep your voices down.

747
00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:30,828
She don't like the chatter.
She's gonna love you.

748
00:41:30,853 --> 00:41:35,406
(foreboding music)

749
00:41:35,431 --> 00:41:36,231
Is that Charles?
Hey, hey, Chuck, it's us!

750
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,116
That's not the Chuck.

751
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:41,035
Ah, shit.
Oh, ableism, great.

752
00:41:51,932 --> 00:41:53,253
That's not gonna go over

753
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:55,553
well with the woke mob.
A Wolverine.

754
00:42:00,457 --> 00:42:01,820
I wondered when I'd get one of you.

755
00:42:01,845 --> 00:42:02,873
You're one of Xavier's.
You know him, you know Chuck?

756
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:08,025
Oh, I knew him.

757
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,189
We shared a womb.
Tried to strangle the sly little fellow

758
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:13,483
with my umbilical cord.

759
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,496
Amen.
I've never loved roommates.

760
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:18,166
Mine's blind, except she could see

761
00:42:20,432 --> 00:42:22,205
cocaine for some reason.
You wanna chime in, Your Majesty?

762
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:24,384
I'm dying here.

763
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:25,483
Who are you?
Charles Xavier's twin, Cassandra Nova.

764
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:26,071
Bullshit. How was the anal birth?

765
00:42:26,096 --> 00:42:27,036
You two are cute.
I have a good feeling about this.

766
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:37,512
(chains falling)

767
00:42:48,606 --> 00:42:49,626
And I've been trying to
catch this little firefly

768
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,386
for years, haven't I, Johnny?

769
00:42:55,411 --> 00:42:56,948
Oh, you picked the wrong
time to make new friends.

770
00:42:57,232 --> 00:42:58,770
Oh, Johnny told us all about you.

771
00:42:58,795 --> 00:43:00,841
Maybe shut up now.
Yeah, maybe don't-- We

772
00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:03,434
were just talking here.

773
00:43:03,919 --> 00:43:05,244
Yeah, Johnny told us you're a psychotic,
megalomaniacal asshole.

774
00:43:05,578 --> 00:43:07,029
His word's not mine.

775
00:43:07,558 --> 00:43:10,261
Hell bent, on domination in pain.
You said all that about me.

776
00:43:10,286 --> 00:43:13,359
No, no!

777
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,565
How do you, I just say anything!
Sticks and stones, Johnny!

778
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:19,887
Don't let her intimidate you.

779
00:43:19,912 --> 00:43:21,632
It's like you said in the convoy.
This finger-licking, dead inside,

780
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,719
pixie slab of

781
00:43:22,744 --> 00:43:24,321
third-rate dime store nut milk
can eat your delicious cinnamon ring

782
00:43:24,346 --> 00:43:26,574
and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.

783
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:28,599
I have never said any of those words
in my entire life! 

784
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:30,488
Have some modesty!

785
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,681
People think I'm a shit-talker,
but this guy, next level.

786
00:43:32,706 --> 00:43:35,609
What?

787
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:39,592
This, I, wait, I don't even know what
half of that means!

788
00:43:40,002 --> 00:43:41,377
My hat's off to you, sir, truly.

789
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:43,598
I didn't, he's, that's, I, I, I don't--
(splattering)

790
00:43:43,623 --> 00:43:44,844
Not my favorite, Chris.

791
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:45,871
You stupid piece of shit, you
just got him fucking killed!

792
00:43:45,896 --> 00:43:47,509
Hey, we're all grieving!

793
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:49,474
PS, do you know what he was
doing to the budget?

794
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:51,519
(shushing)

795
00:43:51,544 --> 00:43:53,529
Alioth is hungry.
There's been some kind of mistake.

796
00:43:54,726 --> 00:43:55,975
Big Yellow is a backup anchor being,

797
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,288
and I'm Marvel Jesus, MJ if you're nasty.
This may be hard to hear,

798
00:43:58,313 --> 00:43:59,157
but there's another British villain.

799
00:44:00,485 --> 00:44:01,559
He's gonna destroy my
universe, and I'm gonna stop him.

800
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:03,866
Oh, honey, you don't really strike me

801
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:05,792
as a world-saving type.
Did I hit a nerve?

802
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,710
I didn't want it to come to this.

803
00:45:21,436 --> 00:45:23,762
Either you help us, or my friend here
is gonna sing the entire

804
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,102
second act of Music Man,

805
00:45:25,127 --> 00:45:26,482
with zero warmup.
Where'd you get the chair?

806
00:45:26,507 --> 00:45:28,088
Well once in a while, I did

807
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,263
get a Charles through here.
Nevermind, though, no.

808
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:45,834
He didn't care to find me.

809
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,173
Agh, Gen-Z and your trauma-bragging!
Can't you just stuff it

810
00:45:47,198 --> 00:45:48,074
down, turn it into accomplishment

811
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:49,299
or cancer like the rest of us?
But I'm not like the rest of you.

812
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:50,444
Except maybe the Wolverine.

813
00:45:51,569 --> 00:45:53,335
Now we could be truly
terrifying together.

814
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,900
You're that scary, huh?

815
00:45:55,925 --> 00:45:57,025
The TVA certainly thought so.
They sent me here before I could walk.

816
00:45:57,782 --> 00:46:00,458
And you know, it's the best thing that

817
00:46:00,816 --> 00:46:02,304
ever happened to me.
I love it here.

818
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:03,750
You live in a garbage dump.

819
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,917
I think we both know who
lives in the garbage dump.

820
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,948
The void is a paradise.

821
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:10,551
I can wield my power here without shame.
Unfortunately, I had no Charles Xavier

822
00:46:10,576 --> 00:46:12,631
to teach me temperance.

823
00:46:12,656 --> 00:46:13,878
What about your Charles?
Did he protect you?

824
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:15,615
Did he make you feel safe?

825
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,054
We're mutants, we're never safe.
(screaming)

826
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:19,047
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

827
00:46:19,072 --> 00:46:20,212
I don't want the smoke.
I don't have any beef with you.

828
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:21,077
I just want to save my friends.

829
00:46:21,456 --> 00:46:23,216
I just, I want to go home.
Well, the thing is, I could get you home.

830
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:24,327
Good.

831
00:46:24,356 --> 00:46:26,247
But I don't want to.
Not good.

832
00:46:26,363 --> 00:46:27,937
(grunting)

833
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,571
What do you want, Wade Wilson?
Uh, your fingers are inside

834
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:36,613
me, but not in a good way.

835
00:46:37,026 --> 00:46:38,170
My brother could enter
one's mind with a thought.

836
00:46:40,163 --> 00:46:42,103
I have to get my hands dirty.

837
00:46:42,128 --> 00:46:44,708
Agh, God.
Shh shh shh shh I've got you.

838
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:45,775
I've got you.

839
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,379
Wade
I can't reach you when you're not here.

840
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:47,318
I'm right here.

841
00:46:47,423 --> 00:46:50,900
No, you're not, I can't.
I'm right here.

842
00:46:50,925 --> 00:46:51,910
Then show me. You gotta do something.

843
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,170
Show you what?
Show me you care about

844
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,510
something bigger than you.

845
00:46:56,535 --> 00:46:57,975
Ever since they turned
you down, you took a knee.

846
00:46:58,370 --> 00:46:59,519
Baby, you never got back up.

847
00:46:59,544 --> 00:47:01,217
I know you're going through something.
Let me go through it with you.

848
00:47:02,169 --> 00:47:04,021
Your crazy matches my crazy.

849
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:06,422
Where'd you go?
Oh my God.

850
00:47:06,447 --> 00:47:11,347
You just say it, okay?

851
00:47:11,372 --> 00:47:15,175
Say, "I don't want you"
"I don't want to be with you."

852
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,420
Go ahead, say it, say it, say it, say it.

853
00:47:18,445 --> 00:47:19,305
You don't want to be with me.
Tell me that and I'll walk away.

854
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:23,959
Say, "I don't want you."

855
00:47:23,984 --> 00:47:27,287
(somber music)
You'll never fucking matter.

856
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:29,782
What?

857
00:47:29,807 --> 00:47:31,059
You'll never fucking matter.
You'll never fucking matter.

858
00:47:31,084 --> 00:47:32,793
She never said that.

859
00:47:38,707 --> 00:47:40,413
No, but I bet she thought it.
Uhh blu-blugh, ugh!

860
00:47:40,438 --> 00:47:41,468
You are so mean.

861
00:47:41,493 --> 00:47:42,633
My brain could taste your fingers
and they tasted like hate.

862
00:47:42,658 --> 00:47:44,449
And where in God's name is

863
00:47:44,474 --> 00:47:47,645
the intimacy coordinator?
You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.

864
00:47:48,854 --> 00:47:50,321
And long before you came here.

865
00:47:51,673 --> 00:47:53,413
This is Baby Knife, she's
gonna fuck you in the face now.

866
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:56,635
If you want to kill me,

867
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,840
it's going to take
more than a little blade.

868
00:47:57,865 --> 00:48:00,854
How about six?

869
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:03,019
(stabbing sound)
Ha ha haaa.

870
00:48:03,044 --> 00:48:05,824
My boy's wicked strong.

871
00:48:08,528 --> 00:48:10,157
That's my big boy, yes you are.
(laughs)

872
00:48:10,448 --> 00:48:12,048
(wooshing noise)

873
00:48:12,073 --> 00:48:14,087
Well, this has been fun,
but the big guy needs to

874
00:48:14,112 --> 00:48:18,971
eat and the rent is due.

875
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,753
(menacing sounds)
By the way, you're the rent.

876
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:23,317
(menacing sounds)

877
00:48:23,581 --> 00:48:24,899
(menacing sounds) (screams)
(metal clanging)

878
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:25,829
Give a

879
00:48:26,355 --> 00:48:29,169
Fuck!
You coming or what?

880
00:48:29,422 --> 00:48:31,990
Coming!

881
00:48:32,015 --> 00:48:36,418
(engine revs)
(engine sputtering)

882
00:48:36,443 --> 00:48:38,183
(grunting sounds)

883
00:48:38,414 --> 00:48:39,904
Whatcha thinking bout?
Get the fuck off of me.

884
00:48:40,148 --> 00:48:42,988
Shh, shh.

885
00:48:43,013 --> 00:48:44,340
Almost done.
Almost done what?

886
00:48:44,365 --> 00:48:46,105
Getting my knife out of your buttocks.

887
00:48:46,434 --> 00:48:49,236
Pervert! Ah, fuck!
Get your mind out of my pants.

888
00:48:49,261 --> 00:48:51,701
I'm telling Blake.

889
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:53,482
New rules.
I talk now.

890
00:48:53,507 --> 00:48:55,026
That's gonna be very

891
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:57,812
hard on the audience.
Shut the fuck up!

892
00:48:57,993 --> 00:48:59,460
Let me fucking think.

893
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:03,701
Now we gotta get back to Paradox, right?
Right!?

894
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:07,254
Je m'excuse? (Exuse me?)

895
00:49:07,908 --> 00:49:14,213
Am I allowed to speak now or--
Just nod, asshole.

896
00:49:14,238 --> 00:49:18,515
Right.

897
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:28,202
Then we find the others.
That poor kid Johnny was talking about

898
00:49:28,227 --> 00:49:29,989
before you got him killed.

899
00:49:30,014 --> 00:49:31,487
Poor kid, he's like 50.
If there's a chance they

900
00:49:31,512 --> 00:49:33,422
know how to get out of here,

901
00:49:33,447 --> 00:49:34,042
we find him and make those TVA fuckers
fix my shit like you fucking promised.

902
00:49:34,067 --> 00:49:35,147
I smell quest.

903
00:49:39,622 --> 00:49:41,962
I smell food.
So what made you finally

904
00:49:43,515 --> 00:49:45,945
wear an honest to God costume?

905
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,950
Mine's red so they can't see me bleed.
But I can see how

906
00:49:48,975 --> 00:49:51,375
yellow would be useful too.

907
00:49:52,504 --> 00:49:53,151
Have you been checked for ADHD?
Nn-nn.

908
00:49:54,601 --> 00:49:56,414
But I've had several STDs,

909
00:50:01,323 --> 00:50:02,690
which were probably caused by ADHD.
What are you looking for?

910
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,411
Oh, thank fuck.

911
00:50:07,436 --> 00:50:10,992
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's rubbing alcohol.

912
00:50:11,017 --> 00:50:12,357
You don't wanna drink-oh.

913
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:14,388
Yup, there you go.
Fuck that liver.

914
00:50:16,087 --> 00:50:16,971
Good. Okay.

915
00:50:17,154 --> 00:50:20,311
What the fuck are those?
Oh.

916
00:50:21,048 --> 00:50:25,245
Back in civilian life, I wear a toupee,

917
00:50:25,474 --> 00:50:27,765
but nobody knows.
(laughs) Everybody knows.

918
00:50:29,228 --> 00:50:31,665
Wanna talk about what's haunting you

919
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,630
or should we wait for
a third act flashback?

920
00:50:34,674 --> 00:50:37,192
Ah go fuck yourself.

921
00:50:39,971 --> 00:50:41,498
You know,
in my world, you're um. You're well regarded.

922
00:50:41,985 --> 00:50:43,245
Yeah, well, not in mine.

923
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:47,895
They don't like me much in mine either.
You don't say.

924
00:50:48,981 --> 00:50:51,221
I wanted to be something.

925
00:50:52,481 --> 00:50:55,269
You know, I, shit.
I wanted to be an Avenger.

926
00:50:55,294 --> 00:50:58,134
Fuck the Avengers.

927
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:05,754
Yeah, I didn't make the cut though.
Same with the X-Men.

928
00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:08,439
When girlfriend left me

929
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:17,188
You had a girlfriend?
Yeah.

930
00:51:23,225 --> 00:51:25,078
Vanessa, when we met, she was a dancer.

931
00:51:25,103 --> 00:51:29,947
We had a whole life. It was good.
But oh boy, I just, mwah

932
00:51:33,172 --> 00:51:35,130
fucked that right up.

933
00:51:35,155 --> 00:51:38,149
But you, you were an X-Men.
Fuck that, you were the X-Man.

934
00:51:40,525 --> 00:51:41,848
You.

935
00:51:41,873 --> 00:51:44,792
The Wolverine.
He was a hero in my world.

936
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,073
Yeah, well, he ain't shit in mine.

937
00:51:48,098 --> 00:51:49,858
You said Logan was a hero, what happened?
He died.

938
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:53,147
How?

939
00:51:54,706 --> 00:51:57,499
Well, technically you
were chest fucked by a tree,

940
00:51:57,524 --> 00:52:00,304
but really you just ran out of batteries

941
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:01,654
trying to save someone.
Who?

942
00:52:03,718 --> 00:52:05,702
The shit heels that grew her

943
00:52:05,761 --> 00:52:09,334
in a lab called her X-23.
But she was just a kid.

944
00:52:14,725 --> 00:52:16,615
A younger, daintier,

945
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,075
somehow meaner version of you.
He died trying to save her.

946
00:52:22,502 --> 00:52:24,408
It was beautiful.

947
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:33,937
Look, Mijo, I know you're hurtin.
My blind, elderly

948
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,333
African-American roommate,

949
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:48,234
Blind Al, always says that
pain teaches us who we are.

950
00:52:48,259 --> 00:52:49,268
Sometimes we need to listen to that pain

951
00:53:09,328 --> 00:53:10,708
instead of running from it.
Holy shit.

952
00:53:10,733 --> 00:53:12,257
Yeah, she's wise.

953
00:53:12,282 --> 00:53:14,297
No, no, no that's her
name, you call her Blind Al.

954
00:53:14,323 --> 00:53:17,117
Well, she's blind.

955
00:53:17,142 --> 00:53:19,865
(Lady in Red plays)
I've never seen you looking

956
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:21,915
as lovely as you did tonight

957
00:53:22,014 --> 00:53:23,442
I've never seen you shine so bright
Lady in red

958
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:24,787
Is dancing with me

959
00:53:24,812 --> 00:53:26,372
She did, she did 
There's nobody here

960
00:53:27,469 --> 00:53:28,549
Look at you.

961
00:53:28,574 --> 00:53:30,823
She's coming with us.
No, she's not.

962
00:53:32,608 --> 00:53:33,540
Oh, yes, she is.

963
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:34,803
Fuck, no.
Oh, yes. Sorry.

964
00:53:34,828 --> 00:53:36,888
Sorry about that.

965
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:39,033
Come here, girl.
Who are you?

966
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:40,866
I'm Deadpool.

967
00:53:41,266 --> 00:53:44,359
And I guess you're Deadpool too.
But in here, everybody calls me Nicepool.

968
00:53:44,384 --> 00:53:46,090
Oh my goodness, wait till

969
00:53:46,115 --> 00:53:48,720
do you see Ladypool.
She is gorgeous.

970
00:53:48,745 --> 00:53:52,427
She just had a baby

971
00:53:52,452 --> 00:53:53,908
too, and-  Can't even tell.
I don't think you're

972
00:53:56,189 --> 00:53:57,309
supposed to say that.

973
00:54:00,209 --> 00:54:04,147
That's okay.
I identify as a feminist, right?

974
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:07,856
Are those gold-plated, 50 caliber

975
00:54:07,976 --> 00:54:10,748
desert eagle pistoleros?
Of course.

976
00:54:10,773 --> 00:54:13,038
To match my ear huggy.

977
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:18,130
Can I have them?
(laughs) Over my dead body.

978
00:54:20,202 --> 00:54:21,482
You're fun.

979
00:54:22,241 --> 00:54:23,665
And I guess you've
already met Mary Puppins.

980
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:26,479
It's AKA Dogpool.

981
00:54:26,504 --> 00:54:28,319
Careful where you put your
hand, she's 90% G-Spot,

982
00:54:28,344 --> 00:54:29,412
and she'll let you know it.

983
00:54:30,857 --> 00:54:31,815
You let this little flirt out of your
sight for one second

984
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:32,595
and she starts shopping for a new papa.

985
00:54:33,549 --> 00:54:34,844
If you can't be a responsible pet owner,
then maybe you don't

986
00:54:36,349 --> 00:54:39,870
deserve this little unicorn.

987
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:44,001
Guilty on all charges, your honor.
Shant happen again.

988
00:54:46,295 --> 00:54:50,945
Why are you so nice?

989
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,150
It costs nothing to be kind.
Shutting the fuck up is also free.

990
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,113
Caliente.

991
00:54:58,156 --> 00:55:03,105
This is Logan.
He's usually shirtless,

992
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,038
but he's let himself go

993
00:55:05,482 --> 00:55:07,242
since the divorce.
Where's your mask?

994
00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:08,246
Come on, guys.

995
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:11,236
Oh, this guy.
We're looking for a group of survivors.

996
00:55:11,799 --> 00:55:13,932
Oh, they're out there.

997
00:55:13,957 --> 00:55:15,071
Yeah.
But Merc to Merc, you better hope

998
00:55:15,096 --> 00:55:15,685
that you don't run

999
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:19,591
into the Deadpool corps.
Yeah, they're crazy.

1000
00:55:20,054 --> 00:55:21,645
They will chop you up

1001
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:23,005
into a thousand pieces
and hide you all over the void.

1002
00:55:23,146 --> 00:55:24,372
If they could only

1003
00:55:24,397 --> 00:55:28,493
process their childhood trauma,
they'd go on one heck

1004
00:55:28,782 --> 00:55:30,647
of a healing journey.

1005
00:55:31,083 --> 00:55:32,461
Look, we're headed for the borderlands.
Do you know where it is?

1006
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,830
Borderlands, yeah, that's 12 clicks.

1007
00:55:36,076 --> 00:55:38,433
Due West, I can lend you
my ride if you like.

1008
00:55:38,814 --> 00:55:39,847
It would be my honor.

1009
00:55:39,872 --> 00:55:41,386
(wind rustling)
Oh, no, no, no, no,

1010
00:55:41,411 --> 00:55:43,990
no, no, absolutely not.

1011
00:55:45,056 --> 00:55:46,788
Nuh-uh, what the?
No, no.

1012
00:55:48,543 --> 00:55:50,423
Just get in the car.

1013
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:53,310
This isn't a car.
This is a Honda fucking Odyssey.

1014
00:55:54,014 --> 00:55:56,634
Throttle response sucks a cock.

1015
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:03,690
Dated infotainment system.
When Honda saw that untreated chlamydia

1016
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:05,289
was making a comeback, they

1017
00:56:06,236 --> 00:56:07,404
invented the Honda Odyssey
to compete.

1018
00:56:07,643 --> 00:56:10,336
Get in the fucking car.

1019
00:56:10,361 --> 00:56:13,446
He'll get you there safe and sound.
Old Betsy always does.

1020
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:14,032
You're gonna have to

1021
00:56:14,057 --> 00:56:17,872
give me my dog back though.
I know, listen.

1022
00:56:17,897 --> 00:56:20,317
Yes child.

1023
00:56:20,342 --> 00:56:23,822
If you ever wanna give her up,
or if she needs a new home,

1024
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,593
or if something should happen to you,

1025
00:56:25,618 --> 00:56:26,867
I'd love to be her papa.
Oh, what would ever happen to me?

1026
00:56:27,263 --> 00:56:29,781
Lots of stuff.

1027
00:56:30,021 --> 00:56:33,303
No, we're running away.
Don't, the corn was too dense, girl.

1028
00:56:33,328 --> 00:56:35,890
Fuck.

1029
00:56:35,915 --> 00:56:38,706
(car door slams)
(car door slams)

1030
00:56:38,731 --> 00:56:39,393
Won't somebody come take me home?

1031
00:56:39,418 --> 00:56:42,889
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out 

1032
00:56:42,914 --> 00:56:44,356
This life

1033
00:57:21,923 --> 00:57:24,135
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new

1034
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,661
I don't know who you are

1035
00:57:25,686 --> 00:57:27,066
But I
I'm with you

1036
00:57:27,091 --> 00:57:28,551
Okay, I'm just gonna ask it.

1037
00:57:28,576 --> 00:57:31,507
What's with the suit?
First thing I did when I flamed out,

1038
00:57:32,176 --> 00:57:33,577
I took mine off.

1039
00:57:33,631 --> 00:57:34,584
Drop it.
It's not that ugly.

1040
00:57:34,935 --> 00:57:36,832
Stop talking about myself.

1041
00:57:36,857 --> 00:57:39,260
Did you make it yourself?
Been there.

1042
00:57:39,285 --> 00:57:42,164
Quit now.

1043
00:57:42,189 --> 00:57:45,129
The X-Men make you wear it?
Those sons of fucking bitches.

1044
00:57:45,154 --> 00:57:46,725
They are not your

1045
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:50,013
friends, I'll tell you that.
Friends don't let friends leave the house

1046
00:57:50,038 --> 00:57:50,827
looking like they fight

1047
00:57:52,423 --> 00:57:56,194
crime for the Los Angeles Rams.
Shut the fuck up about the suit.

1048
00:57:56,219 --> 00:57:57,147
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1049
00:57:57,172 --> 00:57:58,728
Watch your frown lines, angel baby.
I'm just trying to bond a little bit.

1050
00:57:58,753 --> 00:57:59,775
Yeah, well then talk

1051
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:01,990
about something else.
Fine.

1052
00:58:02,015 --> 00:58:03,145
(Spider Man web slinger sounds)

1053
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:07,071
Stop it.
If they can fix your world.

1054
00:58:07,096 --> 00:58:10,012
What's the first thing you're gonna do

1055
00:58:10,037 --> 00:58:11,502
when you get out of here?
Some rubbing alcohol shots?

1056
00:58:11,527 --> 00:58:15,514
Maybe a wiper fluid chaser?

1057
00:58:15,539 --> 00:58:17,704
What did you say?
So when you get back,

1058
00:58:17,729 --> 00:58:19,914
what's the first thing you're gonna do?

1059
00:58:19,939 --> 00:58:22,234
No, no, no, before that.
IF they can fix your world?

1060
00:58:22,259 --> 00:58:24,385
(car brakes)

1061
00:58:24,562 --> 00:58:25,684
(tires screetch)
What do you mean if. I mean--

1062
00:58:25,709 --> 00:58:27,151
You lied to me.

1063
00:58:27,176 --> 00:58:28,965
You don't have a fucking clue if
they can help me fix things,

1064
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:30,530
do you?

1065
00:58:30,555 --> 00:58:32,297
No, I mean--
Oh, fuck!

1066
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:36,036
Fuck!

1067
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,328
I didn't lie.
You lied.

1068
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:41,834
No, I made an educated wish.

1069
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,293
Because I need you.
This, this is why.

1070
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:46,150
Right here.

1071
00:58:46,175 --> 00:58:47,344
Because if we don't
do something, they die.

1072
00:58:47,369 --> 00:58:50,759
I don't know anything

1073
00:58:50,784 --> 00:58:51,873
about saving worlds.
And why would I even care?

1074
00:58:51,898 --> 00:58:54,725
Because my entire world is

1075
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,957
right here in this picture.
It's only nine people,

1076
00:58:56,982 --> 00:58:58,751
and I have no idea how to save it alone.

1077
00:58:58,776 --> 00:58:59,893
I know how to fuck people up for money,
but you, you, know how to save them.

1078
00:58:59,918 --> 00:59:00,906
At least other Wolverine did.

1079
00:59:00,931 --> 00:59:03,887
Oh, fuck!
I guess I'm stuck with the worst one.

1080
00:59:03,912 --> 00:59:05,451
Did you say you made an

1081
00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:07,318
educated fucking wish?
They call me the Merc with the Mouth.

1082
00:59:10,769 --> 00:59:11,940
They don't call me Truthful Timmy,

1083
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:12,994
the blowjob queen of Saskatoon.
(claws retracting)

1084
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:15,139
Agh!

1085
00:59:15,164 --> 00:59:17,357
One more word.
Please give me one.

1086
00:59:17,382 --> 00:59:19,562
Gubernatorial.

1087
00:59:19,587 --> 00:59:21,794
(screams)
You know what, you're a fucking joke.

1088
00:59:21,819 --> 00:59:22,999
No wonder the Avengers didn't take you.

1089
00:59:23,024 --> 00:59:25,879
Or the X-Men, they'll
take fucking anyone.

1090
00:59:25,904 --> 00:59:28,774
I mean, you are a

1091
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:29,758
ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron.
I have never met a

1092
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:31,943
sadder, more attention-starved,

1093
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:33,953
jabbering little prick in my entire life.
And that says a lot,

1094
00:59:33,978 --> 00:59:35,571
because I've been alive

1095
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:38,023
for more than 200 fucking years.
I'll tell ya, that bald

1096
00:59:38,404 --> 00:59:39,541
chick was right about one thing.

1097
00:59:39,566 --> 00:59:40,270
You will never save the world.
You couldn't even save a relationship

1098
00:59:40,295 --> 00:59:41,435
with a goddamn stripper.

1099
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,902
And motherfucker, I wish I
could say you die alone,

1100
00:59:42,927 --> 00:59:45,805
but it's one of God's best

1101
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,710
jokes that you can't die,
except that's on all of us.

1102
00:59:47,735 --> 00:59:49,556
(panting)

1103
00:59:49,698 --> 00:59:51,135
You got nothing to say, mouth?
I'm gonna fight you now.

1104
00:59:54,844 --> 00:59:55,462
Oh, are you?

1105
00:59:55,487 --> 00:59:56,802
(grunts)
(radio starts playing)

1106
00:59:56,827 --> 00:59:59,999
Oh you

1107
01:00:01,205 --> 01:00:02,031
Not talking now are ya?
(grunts)

1108
01:00:03,737 --> 01:00:05,290
Ow you dirty, bitch!

1109
01:00:30,532 --> 01:00:32,242
(grunts)
(screams)

1110
01:00:32,267 --> 01:00:33,476
(grunts)

1111
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:35,903
(grunts)
(grunts)

1112
01:00:35,928 --> 01:00:36,510
(grunts)

1113
01:00:36,535 --> 01:00:37,276
(glass shattering)
No, no, no.

1114
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:38,311
(screams)

1115
01:00:38,336 --> 01:00:39,746
(grunts)
Nice.

1116
01:00:39,771 --> 01:00:40,466
I take it all back, the

1117
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:42,047
Honda Odyssey fucks hard.
Too bad you don't needle dick.

1118
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:44,067
Oh, we're just getting started, bub.

1119
01:00:44,092 --> 01:00:47,937
(screams)
(music plays)

1120
01:00:47,962 --> 01:00:49,924
(engine revs)

1121
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:51,257
(engine revs)
Thor!

1122
01:00:51,282 --> 01:00:54,688
Where are we?

1123
01:00:54,713 --> 01:00:56,134
No clue, but I like it here.
(sword clang)

1124
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:56,881
Whoa whoa whoa!

1125
01:01:03,922 --> 01:01:04,854
(dramatic music)
Okay, look at you, all.

1126
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:10,058
You must be the others.

1127
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,311
Terrific.
So just to refresh, you are one--

1128
01:01:11,336 --> 01:01:12,881
Electra. Electra, yes.

1129
01:01:12,906 --> 01:01:13,903
Who could forget?
And you, I was not

1130
01:01:13,928 --> 01:01:15,594
expecting to see you here,

1131
01:01:15,619 --> 01:01:16,979
thought you were, you know, retired.
Retarded?

1132
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,514
Retired.

1133
01:01:23,798 --> 01:01:26,053
I'm already in the void.
I'm not trying to get canceled again.

1134
01:01:26,197 --> 01:01:26,631
I don't like you.

1135
01:01:26,656 --> 01:01:30,070
You never did.
And who's this succulent

1136
01:01:30,095 --> 01:01:31,062
reminder of my own inadequacies?

1137
01:01:31,332 --> 01:01:32,825
Look at you.
You look like the

1138
01:01:32,858 --> 01:01:33,922
superhero version of Hawkeye.

1139
01:01:33,947 --> 01:01:34,821
The name's Remy LeBeau.
Le Diable Blanc (The White Devil)

1140
01:01:34,846 --> 01:01:37,894
but you can call me the Gambit.

1141
01:01:38,976 --> 01:01:40,816
It's been a while
since I've seen Sling Blade

1142
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:42,212
hit me again.

1143
01:01:42,237 --> 01:01:45,072
They call me the Gambit.
Do they?

1144
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:47,237
Are you sure you didn't just really,

1145
01:01:47,262 --> 01:01:49,535
really want them to,
but it never quite worked out?

1146
01:01:49,645 --> 01:01:51,139
Bon de rien (Good for nothing)

1147
01:01:51,164 --> 01:01:54,607
You know, we never had
a Wolverine up in here.

1148
01:01:54,632 --> 01:01:56,432
But I can tell you now, it's just a

1149
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:59,669
common courtesy to ask
before you drink up all of my liquor.

1150
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:02,013
That's a good thing I don't give a fuck.

1151
01:02:02,038 --> 01:02:04,565
(chuckles)
Couillon, va! (You dumbass!)

1152
01:02:04,918 --> 01:02:06,616
(glass shattering) Fuck!

1153
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:10,269
So embarrassing.
Well, now that that's settled,

1154
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:15,661
look, we came a long

1155
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,287
way to find you three.
There's four of us.

1156
01:02:18,312 --> 01:02:23,133
There's four?

1157
01:02:25,851 --> 01:02:27,538
Wait, is it Magneto?
Dear sweet God in

1158
01:02:28,131 --> 01:02:30,607
heaven, let it be Magneto,

1159
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,364
because with him- He's dead.
Fuck!

1160
01:02:37,824 --> 01:02:39,950
Now Disney gets cheap?

1161
01:02:40,759 --> 01:02:42,768
It's like Pinocchio
jammed his face in my ass

1162
01:02:42,793 --> 01:02:45,265
and started lying like crazy.

1163
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:50,799
Ohh you nasty (jabbering in Cajun) huh?
Not a single word,

1164
01:02:50,824 --> 01:02:57,448
what do you do exactly?

1165
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:02,919
Charge the playing cards.
Make them go boom.

1166
01:03:02,944 --> 01:03:06,052
Your power's close

1167
01:03:06,077 --> 01:03:08,587
up magic, that's good.
We're not totally fucked at all.

1168
01:03:08,612 --> 01:03:13,376
So who brought us here?

1169
01:03:13,401 --> 01:03:16,295
That would be me.
(somber music)

1170
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,903
Don't make me regret it.

1171
01:03:17,928 --> 01:03:20,943
Holy shit, Logan,
that's her, that's X-23.

1172
01:03:24,808 --> 01:03:28,601
She's the one they told you about.

1173
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:38,031
How did you all get stuck in the void?
There was a knock at the door,

1174
01:03:39,171 --> 01:03:41,174
TVA sent me here.

1175
01:03:42,104 --> 01:03:44,464
Me too.
Maybe I was born here, so

1176
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,790
it's hard to know for sure.

1177
01:04:00,134 --> 01:04:01,618
TVA decided our universe was dying,
and I never even got a

1178
01:04:35,169 --> 01:04:36,557
chance to fight for it.

1179
01:04:47,256 --> 01:04:49,429
People like us don't go quietly.
TVA knows that, so they took us out.

1180
01:04:54,663 --> 01:04:56,269
The answer is yes, I'm in.

1181
01:04:58,906 --> 01:05:00,895
In what?
A team.

1182
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,579
Me, you, you and me, all of us together.

1183
01:05:02,604 --> 01:05:05,959
Let's get the fuck out of this place.
Don't listen to him, he's a fucking liar

1184
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:13,276
It was an educated wish!

1185
01:06:03,814 --> 01:06:04,814
Ha! Look.
We've been inside Cassandra's lair.

1186
01:06:08,149 --> 01:06:09,726
The only way out of

1187
01:06:09,751 --> 01:06:12,051
the void is through her.
She can get us home.

1188
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:11,786
She told us.

1189
01:07:12,382 --> 01:07:16,118
Wait a minute, you've been inside?
And you made it out alive?

1190
01:07:16,321 --> 01:07:17,158
Bullshit.

1191
01:07:17,447 --> 01:07:19,301
Nobody's ever done that.
We did.

1192
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,786
Every time one of us

1193
01:07:21,811 --> 01:07:23,314
is going up against her,
they die.

1194
01:07:24,062 --> 01:07:25,074
The Punisher, the

1195
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:27,273
Quicksilver, the Daredevil.
Daredevil, I'm so sorry.

1196
01:07:27,298 --> 01:07:28,878
It's fine.

1197
01:07:29,073 --> 01:07:30,739
Okay.
Even that sweet baby angel, Johnny Storm,

1198
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,396
he up and going missing

1199
01:07:33,369 --> 01:07:35,619
like, what, two days ago?
Ah, that's so sad.

1200
01:07:35,644 --> 01:07:36,832
Wherever this Johnny fella

1201
01:07:36,857 --> 01:07:39,085
is, I'm sure he's thriving.
Look, there's strength

1202
01:07:39,702 --> 01:07:46,067
in numbers, all right?

1203
01:07:46,092 --> 01:07:48,633
Us, plus you guys, we can
put Cassandra over our knee

1204
01:07:48,658 --> 01:07:50,701
and force her to let us out of the void.

1205
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,668
I know what it means to feel self-doubt.
I don't feel that at all.

1206
01:07:53,693 --> 01:07:57,454
I'm good.

1207
01:07:57,479 --> 01:07:59,271
Know how you get your gut like
a coked up tape worm.

1208
01:07:59,296 --> 01:08:03,405
It's like you're holding up

1209
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:04,550
a mirror to my soul.
You guys may not have been

1210
01:08:04,923 --> 01:08:07,625
able to save your universes,

1211
01:08:08,094 --> 01:08:11,133
but you can avenge them.
It's what Johnny would have wanted.

1212
01:08:11,158 --> 01:08:13,197
Wait, you knew Johnny?

1213
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:15,205
Oh yeah.
Dickhead here, talk to

1214
01:08:15,305 --> 01:08:16,698
him, and we'll team up.

1215
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:19,590
When Johnny came down with
a little case of the dead.

1216
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:24,199
No, no, no, no, we don't know that.

1217
01:08:24,547 --> 01:08:25,514
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1218
01:08:25,539 --> 01:08:26,539
If he survived that,

1219
01:08:26,564 --> 01:08:28,595
he is praying for death.
Thank you, Dr. Wolverine.

1220
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,561
Spill it!

1221
01:08:30,586 --> 01:08:32,041
What you do to Johnny, huh?
Talk or I'm gonna start dealing.

1222
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,433
Okay, okay, hey, hey, hey.

1223
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:35,573
Okay, he ran his fatass
mouth about Cassandra,

1224
01:08:35,598 --> 01:08:37,613
and she zip-zapped his skin,

1225
01:08:37,638 --> 01:08:39,340
leaving his organs to
splash crudely onto the ground

1226
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,154
while the soil greedily drank his blood.

1227
01:08:41,179 --> 01:08:44,312
It was horrible.
He was like a brother to me.

1228
01:08:44,337 --> 01:08:47,089
Look, he died before he

1229
01:08:47,146 --> 01:08:48,571
could make a difference,
but maybe you couldn't save your world,

1230
01:08:48,596 --> 01:08:49,949
but Jesus Christ, you could save mine.

1231
01:08:49,974 --> 01:08:52,174
I don't give a shit about your world,
but if these two made

1232
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:53,559
it out of there alive,

1233
01:08:53,584 --> 01:08:55,393
maybe together, we could
get back in and take her down.

1234
01:08:55,418 --> 01:08:56,858
Where I come from?

1235
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:09,449
We call that suicide, cher.
If we can block her psychic powers,

1236
01:09:09,643 --> 01:09:10,746
we can get a leg up.

1237
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:13,227
I know it.
Now, I know Magneto's dead,

1238
01:09:13,252 --> 01:09:15,722
but I venture to guess that his helmet

1239
01:09:19,046 --> 01:09:21,485
is lying around here somewhere.
Cassandra melted that helmet. Fuck!

1240
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:22,873
After she killed him. Fuck!

1241
01:09:22,898 --> 01:09:24,346
She don't blink.
She knows that helmet was the only way

1242
01:09:24,371 --> 01:09:25,159
to protect anyone from her powers.

1243
01:09:25,184 --> 01:09:27,819
The only other helmet
that strong is Juggernauts,

1244
01:09:27,844 --> 01:09:30,424
but he works for Cassandra.

1245
01:09:30,506 --> 01:09:33,143
Juggernauts helmet, that's it.
And we don't be knowing

1246
01:09:35,406 --> 01:09:37,686
that lid ain't coming off.

1247
01:09:37,711 --> 01:09:40,670
Without that dome gonna come out with it.
I'm so sorry, beautiful,

1248
01:09:40,695 --> 01:09:41,774
I want this to be gentle

1249
01:09:41,799 --> 01:09:42,754
Who is your dialect coach?
The Minions?

1250
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:43,556
I feel like we're missing

1251
01:09:43,581 --> 01:09:44,322
critical exposition here.
I'm sick of this shit.

1252
01:09:44,352 --> 01:09:46,741
I'm sick of hiding.

1253
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,288
Let's face it, our
world's forgot about us.

1254
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:50,233
Or, never learned about us.

1255
01:09:50,258 --> 01:09:51,936
The heroes we were.
Lives we saved.  Or wanted to save.

1256
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:53,584
Maybe these two are our chance,

1257
01:09:53,903 --> 01:09:56,713
(gurgling)
to be remembered the way we deserve.

1258
01:09:56,738 --> 01:09:59,258
Yes. An ending.

1259
01:09:59,283 --> 01:10:00,957
Legacy.
Yes, yes, let this man cook.

1260
01:10:00,982 --> 01:10:02,044
This is what I'm talking about.

1261
01:10:02,069 --> 01:10:03,821
Big slow motion, fight. Sad music,
everybody working together.

1262
01:10:03,846 --> 01:10:05,034
Who knows if you live or

1263
01:10:05,059 --> 01:10:06,859
die, that sort of thing.
Who's ready?

1264
01:10:06,884 --> 01:10:07,595
I was born ready.

1265
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:11,623
Yes, Gambit!
I ain't know my daddy,

1266
01:10:11,648 --> 01:10:14,388
but I'm sure I shot

1267
01:10:14,413 --> 01:10:15,914
out of his dick ready.
Jesus Christ, that is graphic.

1268
01:10:15,939 --> 01:10:17,227
Yeah, he was laying them buttery nuts

1269
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:26,027
all up in my mama
and I shot out there and

1270
01:10:26,052 --> 01:10:28,432
I said, "What's up, doc?"

1271
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:30,438
Johnny must've loved you.
X-23, what's it gonna be?

1272
01:10:30,463 --> 01:10:32,402
The name's Laura.

1273
01:10:32,427 --> 01:10:34,437
Let's fucking go.
Let's fucking go.

1274
01:10:34,462 --> 01:10:36,032
So, let's kick it and go.

1275
01:10:36,057 --> 01:10:38,293
Yeah, we're doing this.
You're all fucking dead.

1276
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:39,628
My god, read the room.

1277
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:41,193
Hey hey I'm not looking for company.
Get out of here.

1278
01:10:41,218 --> 01:10:42,870
You remind me of him.  Angry, drunk, mean.

1279
01:10:42,895 --> 01:10:44,945
Sounds like a great guy.
I wasn't finished.

1280
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:46,779
Showed up when it mattered the most.

1281
01:10:46,804 --> 01:10:49,520
Couldn't help it.
You might not know it, but

1282
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:51,455
you're a good man, Logan.

1283
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,328
You might not know it, but
apparently I'm the worst,

1284
01:10:53,353 --> 01:10:56,447
Logan.

1285
01:10:56,879 --> 01:10:57,759
I got to have a life because of you.
I got to grow up because of you.

1286
01:10:58,353 --> 01:11:00,156
A lot of kids didn't.

1287
01:11:00,181 --> 01:11:02,630
A lot of kids didn't
grow up because of me.

1288
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:04,131
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

1289
01:11:04,156 --> 01:11:06,597
That suit says different.
Yeah?

1290
01:11:06,622 --> 01:11:09,517
What do you like it?

1291
01:11:09,542 --> 01:11:11,262
Scott used to beg me to wear it.
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

1292
01:11:11,287 --> 01:11:13,142
All of them.

1293
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:14,822
Wanted me to be part of the team but I didn't
Told them they all

1294
01:11:14,847 --> 01:11:16,328
looked fucking ridiculous.

1295
01:11:16,626 --> 01:11:19,942
I couldn't have them
thinking I wanted to be there.

1296
01:11:19,967 --> 01:11:21,841
And then one day,

1297
01:11:21,866 --> 01:11:24,066
while I was off on my own,
the humans came.

1298
01:11:24,091 --> 01:11:25,835
And went mutant hunting.

1299
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,475
I can guess the rest.
No, no, let me.

1300
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:29,559
Let me say it.

1301
01:11:29,846 --> 01:11:31,966
I need to say it.
By the time I stumbled

1302
01:11:31,991 --> 01:11:34,340
shit faced from the bar,

1303
01:11:34,365 --> 01:11:36,820
it was too late.
They were dead, every...

1304
01:11:36,845 --> 01:11:38,696
(dramatic music)

1305
01:11:38,721 --> 01:11:41,497
This suit's all I got to
remind me of who they were.

1306
01:11:41,522 --> 01:11:44,362
And what I did.

1307
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:45,883
We're headed to Cassandra's at sun up.
Have fun, not my fight.

1308
01:11:45,908 --> 01:11:47,427
We won't pull this off without you.

1309
01:11:47,452 --> 01:11:49,557
Hey, whoever you think I am
you got the wrong guy.

1310
01:11:49,582 --> 01:11:51,401
You were always the wrong guy.

1311
01:11:51,426 --> 01:11:56,935
(dramatic music)
What?

1312
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,135
Alioth didn't get them.

1313
01:11:58,166 --> 01:11:59,385
Cassandra wanted to play
with them herself first.

1314
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:00,513
They got away.

1315
01:12:00,538 --> 01:12:01,157
Did they find the others?
No.

1316
01:12:01,182 --> 01:12:04,236
Good, all right, phew.

1317
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:06,241
The others found them.
Oh, very cute, well done, Pyro.

1318
01:12:06,266 --> 01:12:07,712
Classic bait and switch

1319
01:12:07,737 --> 01:12:09,377
you really got me there.
Relax.

1320
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:14,301
They come after Nova, she'll handle it.

1321
01:12:14,326 --> 01:12:15,927
Cassandra is a lunatic wild card.
Why do you think we put

1322
01:12:15,952 --> 01:12:17,034
her there in the first place?

1323
01:12:17,059 --> 01:12:20,442
Thank God she's never
chosen to leave the void.

1324
01:12:20,931 --> 01:12:22,692
The time ripper is

1325
01:12:22,717 --> 01:12:24,101
hours away from completion.
I cannot take any chances.

1326
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:27,297
Maybe not, but I can.

1327
01:12:27,322 --> 01:12:29,210
For a price.
Why do you have to say

1328
01:12:29,235 --> 01:12:31,818
it, in that silly voice?

1329
01:12:31,843 --> 01:12:33,383
It's so icky.
You want it done or not?

1330
01:12:33,622 --> 01:12:36,062
All right, your price, take her out.

1331
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:39,480
Ugh Mutants.
Woo!

1332
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:42,879
Bring them out, bring them out

1333
01:12:43,427 --> 01:12:44,919
Bring them out, bring them out
It's hard to yell when

1334
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:46,636
when the barrel's in ya mouth

1335
01:12:46,661 --> 01:12:47,926
Come on
Bring them out, bring them out

1336
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,440
Hey Bring them out, bring them out

1337
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:51,139
TIP, coming live
from the VIP

1338
01:12:51,164 --> 01:12:53,140
Heard the night light 

1339
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:53,849
life lost life without me
Both the Feds and the State wanna see 'bout me

1340
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:56,322
The whole city got biz-zerk, he got three

1341
01:12:56,347 --> 01:12:59,635
Woo look at that, there.
See them big'em hands come close?

1342
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,435
They not a want    

1343
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:05,571
an up inside there.
What Gambit's trying to say

1344
01:13:05,596 --> 01:13:08,697
is getting Juggernaut's helmet

1345
01:13:08,722 --> 01:13:10,170
ain't gonna be easy.
I'm just making stuff up with this.

1346
01:13:10,195 --> 01:13:12,058
Yeah, tilt up to Blade.

1347
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:14,468
Gun!
This is

1348
01:13:14,493 --> 01:13:16,179
Mississippi to Philly,

1349
01:13:16,204 --> 01:13:18,147
Albuquerque to Chatt Town
If I hit you in the face 

1350
01:13:18,172 --> 01:13:20,657
you gon' be suin' and shit

1351
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:33,636
Where do you get that little beauty?
That's the Punisher's AT4.

1352
01:13:33,661 --> 01:13:34,811
Which Punisher?

1353
01:13:36,357 --> 01:13:39,968
There's been like five of them.
There's only been one Blade.

1354
01:13:39,993 --> 01:13:41,161
There's only ever gonna be one Blade.

1355
01:13:41,186 --> 01:13:42,098
Who got a flow and a live
show better than mine

1356
01:13:43,964 --> 01:13:46,230
I got a packed house yellin' 

1357
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:48,837
Incoming!
Bring them out, bring them out

1358
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,220
Bring them out, bring them out

1359
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:56,507
Bring them out, bring them out
Bring them out, bring them out

1360
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,668
(dramatic fire whooshing)

1361
01:14:03,487 --> 01:14:05,907
(tire screetching)
(car hatch opening)

1362
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,294
(footstep)

1363
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:13,432
(dramatic music)
(dramatic music)

1364
01:14:13,587 --> 01:14:16,287
(dramatic music)

1365
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,003
(dramatic music)
(dramatic music)

1366
01:14:20,834 --> 01:14:22,726
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1367
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:24,879
You know how long I've
been waiting for this?

1368
01:14:26,914 --> 01:14:29,754
Whoo, I'm about to make

1369
01:14:30,697 --> 01:14:33,577
a name for myself here.
I don't think you

1370
01:14:35,448 --> 01:14:36,801
guys walk away from this.

1371
01:14:37,872 --> 01:14:40,743
You just make sure people know what
happened here today.

1372
01:14:41,407 --> 01:14:43,633
When you get out of here,

1373
01:14:43,954 --> 01:14:45,094
you have a drink for me, yeah?
You'll stay on our six and get inside.

1374
01:14:46,346 --> 01:14:50,099
We'll make sure you get the package.

1375
01:14:55,046 --> 01:14:58,269
And we'll get our ending.
(dramatic music)

1376
01:14:58,887 --> 01:15:00,901
(dramatic music)

1377
01:15:01,514 --> 01:15:02,751
(screaming)
(dramatic music)

1378
01:15:02,776 --> 01:15:03,925
A boom!

1379
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,706
(screaming)
Some motherfucker's still

1380
01:15:08,894 --> 01:15:11,194
trying to ice skate up here.

1381
01:15:12,634 --> 01:15:16,923
(screaming)
You two escaping I could live with,

1382
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:22,026
but coming back, willingly.

1383
01:15:28,254 --> 01:15:32,401
Boys are so silly.
I just need to get home.

1384
01:15:33,047 --> 01:15:34,782
Well, that's not on the menu, I'm afraid.

1385
01:15:47,277 --> 01:15:49,492
It's death or
enslavement, a la carte, of course.

1386
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:52,421
Up you go--

1387
01:15:54,997 --> 01:15:58,490
(screaming)
Finally, it's nice to give

1388
01:16:03,787 --> 01:16:07,386
someone else a chance to talk.

1389
01:16:09,788 --> 01:16:12,315
Not my strong suit.
(screaming)

1390
01:16:37,714 --> 01:16:38,421
(screaming)

1391
01:16:38,446 --> 01:16:40,156
(screaming)
You shouldn't have done that.

1392
01:16:40,707 --> 01:16:42,899
(screaming)

1393
01:16:42,924 --> 01:16:44,173
Adios, pendejo.
(screaming)

1394
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:45,798
You are an interesting one, aren't you?

1395
01:16:45,823 --> 01:16:46,995
I do feel like you get
lost behind all of his.

1396
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:48,322
(humming)

1397
01:16:48,347 --> 01:16:52,065
Deadpools are a dime a
dozen here in the void.

1398
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:53,003
But you, what's going on in here?

1399
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:56,083
(growling)
(silence)

1400
01:16:56,108 --> 01:16:58,426
Interesting.

1401
01:16:58,451 --> 01:17:00,711
Not what I expected back here
Behind the anger

1402
01:17:00,736 --> 01:17:02,817
You're hiding, from them,

1403
01:17:02,842 --> 01:17:05,600
from all the ones you let down.
So much pain.

1404
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:07,979
I walked away.

1405
01:17:08,004 --> 01:17:10,246
They called after me and I walked away.
I always do.

1406
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,196
I know.

1407
01:17:12,221 --> 01:17:14,261
That's not all you did, is it?
(growling)

1408
01:17:14,286 --> 01:17:16,408
You found them, the X-Men?

1409
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:19,154
Dead.
Dead

1410
01:17:45,241 --> 01:17:49,620
But I would.

1411
01:17:49,645 --> 01:17:52,233
What did you do?
I started killing and I couldn't stop.

1412
01:17:52,258 --> 01:17:53,036
I didn't want to stop.

1413
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:59,386
All those bad men.
It's not just the bad ones.

1414
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:01,257
My little animal.

1415
01:18:01,282 --> 01:18:03,744
I turned the whole
world against the X-Men.

1416
01:18:03,769 --> 01:18:05,134
Just once.

1417
01:18:05,495 --> 01:18:07,189
I want to be the man
that Charles thought I was.

1418
01:18:07,835 --> 01:18:10,001
Logan, in the void you

1419
01:19:19,185 --> 01:19:21,245
can be all that you are.
I just want to be free.

1420
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:24,090
I can set you free.

1421
01:19:24,115 --> 01:19:26,452
I can silence all those voices. I've got you.
I've got you.

1422
01:19:26,477 --> 01:19:28,471
No, I got you.

1423
01:19:28,496 --> 01:19:30,656
(screaming) Get it off!
You're gonna send us home

1424
01:19:30,681 --> 01:19:32,752
or I'm gonna twist

1425
01:19:32,777 --> 01:19:35,149
your fucking head off.
Why are you laughing?

1426
01:19:35,174 --> 01:19:37,562
I can't send you home unless you

1427
01:19:37,587 --> 01:19:38,887
get this thing off my head.
And as soon as you do that,

1428
01:21:21,188 --> 01:21:24,283
I'm going to boil your

1429
01:21:30,798 --> 01:21:32,945
brains on an atomic level
whilst flicking my bean

1430
01:21:33,043 --> 01:21:34,983
to the Enya box set.

1431
01:21:35,008 --> 01:21:36,494
There's an Enya box set?
Either you kill me or I kill you.

1432
01:21:37,663 --> 01:21:39,257
Both wonderful options.

1433
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:40,803
You want me to do it?
No, I'll do it.

1434
01:21:40,828 --> 01:21:43,188
I have her neck right

1435
01:21:43,213 --> 01:21:45,434
here, it's really no problem.
You'll screw it up.

1436
01:21:45,459 --> 01:21:46,820
Oh come on, Mr. PG-13

1437
01:21:46,845 --> 01:21:48,342
except the last one.
What the fuck?

1438
01:21:53,396 --> 01:21:54,277
No, no, no.

1439
01:21:54,302 --> 01:21:56,621
You have no idea what it's like.
Day after day, shovel the shit.

1440
01:21:56,646 --> 01:21:58,461
Fetch the meats.

1441
01:22:16,383 --> 01:22:17,990
I have spent my entire
Exist-

1442
01:22:37,342 --> 01:22:39,956
Not everyone gets a speech.

1443
01:22:41,396 --> 01:22:43,756
She's gonna die.
Okay, hey, hey, if I

1444
01:22:44,029 --> 01:22:45,829
take this helmet off,

1445
01:22:45,854 --> 01:22:48,724
you promise you won't kill us.
I promise I will kill you first.

1446
01:22:50,196 --> 01:22:53,147
Why are you like this?

1447
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:54,910
I wish I knew.
Take it off.

1448
01:22:55,342 --> 01:22:58,911
What?

1449
01:23:12,339 --> 01:23:13,677
Take it off.
Why?

1450
01:23:14,413 --> 01:23:16,833
Just take it off.

1451
01:23:17,479 --> 01:23:19,363
This is our only chance to fix our shit.
Take it off!

1452
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,146
I am wearing the suit.

1453
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:26,251
And that means a lot of things,
but most of all, it means I'm an X-Man.

1454
01:23:26,276 --> 01:23:28,787
And I know your brother.

1455
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:32,324
As much as I'm wanna fucking kill you,
every bone in my body

1456
01:23:34,107 --> 01:23:35,447
wants to fucking kill you.

1457
01:23:36,493 --> 01:23:38,208
He would not let me
stand here and watch you die.

1458
01:23:38,233 --> 01:23:40,133
Take your hands off.

1459
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:41,728
This is for him.
This is for Charles.

1460
01:23:41,753 --> 01:23:43,447
(dramatic music)

1461
01:23:45,113 --> 01:23:47,109
No no no, don't you dare do me like Johnny.
My brother loved you.

1462
01:23:47,134 --> 01:23:48,260
He loved all of us.

1463
01:23:51,686 --> 01:23:53,246
Hmm. Must be nice.
He would have loved you too.

1464
01:23:53,765 --> 01:23:55,514
If he knew about you,

1465
01:24:00,263 --> 01:24:01,363
if he knew where you were,
he would have torn a

1466
01:24:04,107 --> 01:24:05,860
hole in the fucking universe

1467
01:24:06,899 --> 01:24:08,766
to bring you home.
This is my home.

1468
01:24:10,953 --> 01:24:12,273
Then at least let us save his.

1469
01:24:12,449 --> 01:24:14,210
...
You wanna hear something crazy?

1470
01:24:14,235 --> 01:24:16,303
An amateur magician

1471
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:20,899
rolled through here
a while back.

1472
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,673
I killed him, of course,

1473
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:28,888
wore his skin around for four days.
But I found this little trinket

1474
01:24:30,446 --> 01:24:34,293
on his lovely fingers.

1475
01:24:40,029 --> 01:24:42,256
Strange.
Marvel sparkle circle.

1476
01:24:43,403 --> 01:24:46,537
What is that?

1477
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:48,552
This is your way home.
I do owe you for saving my life,

1478
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:53,596
but let's keep things interesting.

1479
01:24:55,803 --> 01:24:58,094
I'd say you have about four seconds
before your life's through.

1480
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:00,030
Ha ha ha race you.

1481
01:25:11,577 --> 01:25:16,757
I'll be seeing you
In all the old familiar

1482
01:25:23,334 --> 01:25:25,060
Places

1483
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:28,400
That this heart of mine
Embraces

1484
01:25:28,524 --> 01:25:29,450
All day through

1485
01:25:30,228 --> 01:25:32,228
In that small cafe
The park across the way

1486
01:25:40,697 --> 01:25:42,397
The children's carousel

1487
01:25:42,422 --> 01:25:45,691
The chestnut trees
the wishing well

1488
01:25:45,716 --> 01:25:47,062
I'll be seeing you

1489
01:25:47,087 --> 01:25:48,727
In every lovely summer's day
I'll find you in the morning sun

1490
01:25:48,752 --> 01:25:51,937
And when the night is new

1491
01:25:51,962 --> 01:25:56,094
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you

1492
01:25:56,119 --> 01:25:58,948
As I guess, we got a standard three year

1493
01:25:58,973 --> 01:26:00,258
bumper to bumper warranty.
Glad you gave us a second chance.

1494
01:26:00,283 --> 01:26:03,244
And don't worry, Wade and I are a team,

1495
01:26:03,637 --> 01:26:05,460
so I'll see you again after--
(loud thuds)

1496
01:26:06,004 --> 01:26:07,287
That feels like a

1497
01:26:07,312 --> 01:26:08,306
Kia, Kia fucking carnival wasn't it?
Oh.

1498
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:10,439
Holy shit, that's Deadpool.

1499
01:26:10,464 --> 01:26:11,385
That's Wolverine.
You damn straight it is.

1500
01:26:11,410 --> 01:26:14,607
Fox killed him.

1501
01:26:14,632 --> 01:26:16,209
Disney brought him back.
They're gonna make him

1502
01:26:18,144 --> 01:26:20,504
do this till he's 90.

1503
01:26:20,529 --> 01:26:23,829
Let's go.
I'll clock you out.

1504
01:26:23,854 --> 01:26:25,393
Forever.

1505
01:26:25,418 --> 01:26:29,084
Forever.
Wakey wakey.

1506
01:26:29,824 --> 01:26:31,970
Hey.

1507
01:26:33,577 --> 01:26:35,116
Now you put all these bullets in my belly
and I'm gonna find out why.

1508
01:26:35,141 --> 01:26:38,461
Whoa, whoa!

1509
01:26:38,486 --> 01:26:41,272
I'll just say it
You don't have to

1510
01:26:41,297 --> 01:26:44,019
stick your fingers in me.

1511
01:26:44,044 --> 01:26:44,876
Jesus, just ask sometimes.
Fine.

1512
01:26:44,901 --> 01:26:45,449
Really?

1513
01:26:45,474 --> 01:26:46,034
Hands and pockets.
A guy named Paradox.

1514
01:26:46,059 --> 01:26:46,702
He said he'd get me out of the void.

1515
01:26:46,727 --> 01:26:47,244
All I know is he works for the TVA.
The TVA?

1516
01:26:47,287 --> 01:26:50,636
We had an agreement.

1517
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:54,004
I don't.
think this guy cares.

1518
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:57,103
Huh, he will.

1519
01:26:57,128 --> 01:26:59,888
Hey people, how much longer
before the time ripper is active?

1520
01:27:00,403 --> 01:27:02,900
We're running the final safety checks.

1521
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:05,571
Oh, okay, all right,
thanks for all your hard work,

1522
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:08,289
Ralph, nice job.

1523
01:27:08,314 --> 01:27:12,534
Really?
No, you drooling boob.

1524
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:15,096
No, we have company,

1525
01:27:16,337 --> 01:27:18,080
cancel the safety checks.
We need to be live now.

1526
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:21,504
Oh, I hate you so much.

1527
01:27:32,631 --> 01:27:35,612
No, stop, piss off, you're too late.
You're fucking done.

1528
01:27:40,613 --> 01:27:42,714
Why was Thor more crying.

1529
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,252
How dare you?
No one comes back from the void.

1530
01:27:47,743 --> 01:27:49,596
Tell that to Cassandra Nova.

1531
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:52,191
Paradox, we have a problem.
Paradox?

1532
01:27:53,696 --> 01:27:56,249
Well you are doughier than

1533
01:27:56,874 --> 01:28:00,841
you looked in Pyro's head,
You tried to kill me.

1534
01:28:00,866 --> 01:28:02,207
I literally have no idea.

1535
01:28:05,464 --> 01:28:07,425
When you come for the king, you better kill the king.
Oh, welcome to the

1536
01:28:07,983 --> 01:28:10,393
skull fuck club, Paradox.

1537
01:28:13,877 --> 01:28:16,394
You know she doesn't wash that hand.
Oh, what's this?

1538
01:28:17,464 --> 01:28:21,344
A time ripper, naughty boy.

1539
01:28:21,369 --> 01:28:23,356
Oh no, we're on it, we're gonna head down
and dismantle that thing now.

1540
01:28:23,424 --> 01:28:26,155
We got you, boo, you just

1541
01:28:26,851 --> 01:28:30,968
keep playing those keys.
I don't want to destroy it.

1542
01:28:31,383 --> 01:28:34,229
I want to use it.

1543
01:28:34,591 --> 01:28:35,854
Now shoo, mommy and daddy
are having a conversation.

1544
01:28:37,694 --> 01:28:39,810
(screaming)

1545
01:28:39,835 --> 01:28:40,435
You know the funny thing is?
I was happy in the void.

1546
01:28:40,794 --> 01:28:43,145
You sent the trash to me,

1547
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:45,271
while I cleaned it up.
Everyone was happy.

1548
01:28:45,296 --> 01:28:48,558
And you had to go and

1549
01:28:48,583 --> 01:28:51,831
piss on my side of the fence.
And so now the fence must come down.

1550
01:28:54,606 --> 01:28:56,993
I'm going to use a little time ripper

1551
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:24,485
and I'm going to destroy this universe
and the next and the next and the next

1552
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:27,734
until all that's left is the void.

1553
01:30:30,638 --> 01:30:32,878
And I get to play God.
Come on.

1554
01:30:32,903 --> 01:30:35,874
Now, who are going to show me how to use

1555
01:30:36,438 --> 01:30:37,638
this fancy gadget of yours?
And don't worry, I've called some friends

1556
01:30:38,111 --> 01:30:39,369
and to make sure we're not disturbed.

1557
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:40,691
Sorry to bother, madam,
but there's something you need to see.

1558
01:30:40,716 --> 01:30:43,964
We're getting indications of an

1559
01:30:43,989 --> 01:30:46,401
unsanctioned time ripper
activating on Earth 10005.

1560
01:30:46,426 --> 01:30:47,405
Whose district is that?

1561
01:30:47,818 --> 01:30:49,442
Paradox.
Well, thank you so much

1562
01:30:49,467 --> 01:30:50,535
for your help, darling.

1563
01:30:51,472 --> 01:30:52,723
God, good to get out of that head.
Wooo what a mess.

1564
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,103
Stop.

1565
01:31:01,128 --> 01:31:02,488
Let's give it a beat
for the extras to clear.

1566
01:31:03,488 --> 01:31:06,509
Go, go, go, go.

1567
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:09,233
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1568
01:31:11,201 --> 01:31:12,789
(music starts playing)

1569
01:31:13,221 --> 01:31:15,091
It's her.
Santa perrita.

1570
01:31:15,116 --> 01:31:17,819
Come on, girl.

1571
01:31:17,994 --> 01:31:18,941
My girl, we don't have to
be a apart, ever again.

1572
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:21,551
Never, ever again.

1573
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:23,424
Sorry.
Fuck!

1574
01:31:24,514 --> 01:31:26,398
What's cafe gratitude doing here?

1575
01:31:26,423 --> 01:31:28,352
Sorry about that.
Tremble not, sweet Mary Puppins.

1576
01:31:28,377 --> 01:31:30,160
Oh, that's a little...

1577
01:31:30,185 --> 01:31:32,508
Come here, girl.
Papa is here.

1578
01:31:32,533 --> 01:31:34,827
Hey, do not insult

1579
01:31:35,608 --> 01:31:36,988
this animal's autonomy.
She can decide who her papa is.

1580
01:31:37,013 --> 01:31:40,382
What's it gonna be, girl, huh?

1581
01:31:40,407 --> 01:31:42,360
Original recipe?
Or Van Milder here.

1582
01:31:42,385 --> 01:31:45,303
Oh, that's funny.

1583
01:31:45,328 --> 01:31:46,267
I can gently tap the fourth wall too.
The Proposal.

1584
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:48,589
The fuck was that?

1585
01:31:48,614 --> 01:31:50,786
Bitch, you think that's what I do?
Both of you, shut up.

1586
01:31:50,811 --> 01:31:52,670
You smell something?

1587
01:31:52,695 --> 01:31:54,395
Yeah, you.
A lot of you.

1588
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,832
Told you there were a lot

1589
01:31:58,857 --> 01:31:59,619
of Deadpools over there?
That's bad.

1590
01:31:59,644 --> 01:32:01,061
I take it they're not friendly.

1591
01:32:01,086 --> 01:32:02,334
Goodness, no.
Sorry about this, boys.

1592
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:04,139
Mission over.

1593
01:32:04,164 --> 01:32:05,704
Cause of death, 100.
Kill thirsty Deadpools.

1594
01:32:14,748 --> 01:32:17,006
They're dumb, but they can fight.

1595
01:32:19,516 --> 01:32:21,029
Not me though.
I'd love to get in the mix,

1596
01:32:23,284 --> 01:32:25,682
but I have low bone density

1597
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:27,130
and I have to keep my face safe.
Hold please.

1598
01:32:27,155 --> 01:32:29,387
Oh, okay.

1599
01:32:29,412 --> 01:32:30,571
All right, look.
Guys!

1600
01:32:30,596 --> 01:32:32,670
Deadpool Prime here.

1601
01:32:32,695 --> 01:32:36,200
Our fight isn't with you.
Hey, when I want your opinions,

1602
01:32:36,225 --> 01:32:38,959
I'll take Wolverine's

1603
01:32:40,272 --> 01:32:41,352
dick out of your mouth.
That's Kidpool, she's the dirtiest.

1604
01:32:42,652 --> 01:32:43,672
Can we just be done?

1605
01:32:43,723 --> 01:32:44,873
Ooh, we're just getting started.
No, no, no, no, no.

1606
01:32:44,898 --> 01:32:47,239
With the whole multiverse thing.

1607
01:32:47,264 --> 01:32:48,865
It's not great.
It's just been miss

1608
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:50,265
after miss after miss.

1609
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:52,395
Look, the Wizard of Oz did the multiverse first
and they did it best.

1610
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:54,000
The gays knew it, but we didn't listen.

1611
01:32:54,305 --> 01:32:57,921
Let's just take the L and move on.
I think it's been

1612
01:33:03,408 --> 01:33:05,247
steadily great since Endgame.

1613
01:33:05,272 --> 01:33:07,219
What are you talking about?
The multiverse is over.

1614
01:33:07,869 --> 01:33:09,331
Cassandy gonna destroy the

1615
01:33:09,356 --> 01:33:11,055
fuck out of every timeline.
Heh, ya'll can't do shit about it.

1616
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,277
Do you not get it?

1617
01:33:13,423 --> 01:33:17,045
If we don't go down to 
the subway and stop her

1618
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:19,933
we all die.

1619
01:33:19,958 --> 01:33:22,147
Say the boss lady
don't want no disturbance.

1620
01:33:22,172 --> 01:33:27,584
You wanna get down to the subway?

1621
01:33:27,609 --> 01:33:29,669
You gotta go through us
Uzi time, baby.

1622
01:33:29,694 --> 01:33:31,342
Uzi time, baby.

1623
01:33:31,367 --> 01:33:35,575
Look alive.
(gun fires)

1624
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,179
I think I'm hit.

1625
01:33:38,204 --> 01:33:39,052
No shit, you did that on purpose.
I did no such thing.

1626
01:33:39,077 --> 01:33:42,074
Listen to me, gorgeous.

1627
01:33:44,365 --> 01:33:47,673
How long does it take
for you to regenerate?

1628
01:33:48,139 --> 01:33:51,063
Regenerate?

1629
01:33:51,088 --> 01:33:53,269
You really are God's
perfect idiot, aren't you?

1630
01:33:54,413 --> 01:33:56,124
I'm okay.

1631
01:33:56,439 --> 01:33:57,534
How dare you, you
insensitive son of a bitch.

1632
01:34:08,848 --> 01:34:11,295
How was I supposed to

1633
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:13,903
know he doesn't regenerate?
I'm not a medicine woman.

1634
01:34:13,928 --> 01:34:15,938
Look, a donut cart.

1635
01:34:23,219 --> 01:34:24,312
They're practically hospitals.
They sell portable triage units.

1636
01:34:24,337 --> 01:34:26,692
They don't.

1637
01:34:26,717 --> 01:34:27,626
I'm gonna get you to safety.
He's not.

1638
01:34:27,651 --> 01:34:29,354
Deep breath.

1639
01:34:33,014 --> 01:34:36,768
(gunshots)
(dartgun blows)

1640
01:34:43,509 --> 01:34:45,036
Hey, why are we stopping?

1641
01:34:46,229 --> 01:34:48,036
Just catching my breath.
Are your legs on vacation?

1642
01:34:54,891 --> 01:34:56,777
You're dead weight.

1643
01:35:10,585 --> 01:35:15,080
It's because I'm paralyzed.
We all have problems.

1644
01:35:15,105 --> 01:35:17,087
Listen to me.

1645
01:35:17,385 --> 01:35:19,978
You're gonna live.
Look at me, Nicepool.

1646
01:35:20,003 --> 01:35:21,039
You're gonna live.

1647
01:35:21,064 --> 01:35:23,364
Say it.
I'm gonna live.

1648
01:35:23,389 --> 01:35:24,989
Say it with me.

1649
01:35:25,014 --> 01:35:26,398
You're gonna live.
I'm gonna-I'm gonna live.

1650
01:35:26,423 --> 01:35:29,125
Ha ha.

1651
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:31,555
Say it louder.
I'm gonna live! 

1652
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:32,720
Hold your fire!

1653
01:35:32,745 --> 01:35:35,516
Sweet little puppy.
Goddamit! 

1654
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:36,968
I don't think he's gonna make it.

1655
01:35:36,993 --> 01:35:39,326
God, he loved his face.
I could taste his final thought.

1656
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:41,433
He was so afraid.

1657
01:35:41,961 --> 01:35:43,534
But he died a hero.
He died from murder, you dumb fuck.

1658
01:35:43,559 --> 01:35:47,053
All I have to remember him by

1659
01:35:47,078 --> 01:35:49,826
are these two gold-plated,
50 caliber desert eagle pistoleros.

1660
01:35:49,851 --> 01:35:51,741
This is for him.

1661
01:36:06,663 --> 01:36:09,430
Are you ready?
I get to kill 100 yous.

1662
01:36:16,413 --> 01:36:20,313
Fuck yeah, I'm ready.

1663
01:36:20,571 --> 01:36:21,891
You don't wanna see this, bub.
That's a good girl.

1664
01:36:44,087 --> 01:36:46,445
(dramatic music)

1665
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:48,735
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone

1666
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:51,356
I hear you call my name

1667
01:36:51,381 --> 01:36:53,840
And it feels like
Home

1668
01:36:53,865 --> 01:36:56,933
(dramatic music)

1669
01:36:56,958 --> 01:36:59,461
Holy shit.
You saved the good

1670
01:36:59,514 --> 01:37:00,741
stuff for special occasions?

1671
01:37:00,766 --> 01:37:02,166
Killing mostly.
What's the wind resistance

1672
01:37:02,523 --> 01:37:03,856
on those blowjob handles?

1673
01:37:04,766 --> 01:37:06,818
Sorry, just a catty
bitch when I'm jealous.

1674
01:37:06,843 --> 01:37:08,100
All right, let's do this.

1675
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:12,106
Maximum effort.
(dramatic music)

1676
01:37:12,131 --> 01:37:13,839
(wind blowing)

1677
01:37:13,864 --> 01:37:14,916
When you call my name
it's like a little prayer

1678
01:37:14,941 --> 01:37:16,849
I'm down on my knees

1679
01:37:16,874 --> 01:37:18,474
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour

1680
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:20,850
I can feel your power

1681
01:37:21,459 --> 01:37:25,934
Just like a prayer
you know I'll take you there

1682
01:37:25,959 --> 01:37:27,821
Life is a mystery

1683
01:37:28,029 --> 01:37:31,548
Everyone must stand alone
(dramatic music)

1684
01:37:31,573 --> 01:37:34,585
I'm down on my knees

1685
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:38,224
I wanna take you there
Motherfucker?

1686
01:37:38,249 --> 01:37:40,277
I wish I were deaf.

1687
01:37:40,308 --> 01:37:41,688
(dramatic music)
(It's like a dream to me) oh yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

1688
01:37:41,713 --> 01:37:42,915
(Just like a prayer, I'll take you there) oh yeah yeah yee

1689
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:46,001
(It's like a dream to me) whoa oh-oh
(gunshots)

1690
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:47,932
(screams)

1691
01:37:47,957 --> 01:37:51,339
(glass shattering)
(dramatic music) (crashing)

1692
01:37:51,364 --> 01:37:53,594
Come on, I blew it.

1693
01:37:53,619 --> 01:37:56,644
After all that, the only
thing you're gonna remember

1694
01:37:56,669 --> 01:37:58,157
is that god-awful dismount.

1695
01:37:58,182 --> 01:38:00,647
(baby cooing)
What are you laughing at, ya little fucker?

1696
01:38:09,125 --> 01:38:10,572
Oh no.

1697
01:38:10,597 --> 01:38:12,386
I guess these ones regenerate.
Come on, we don't have time for this.

1698
01:38:12,411 --> 01:38:13,828
Deadpools, stand down.

1699
01:38:13,853 --> 01:38:16,513
(dramatic music)
(crashing)

1700
01:38:16,717 --> 01:38:17,844
This Deadpool's with me.

1701
01:38:23,823 --> 01:38:26,296
Oh no.
Holy shit.

1702
01:38:26,321 --> 01:38:29,641
That's fucking Peter.

1703
01:38:29,666 --> 01:38:31,626
(screaming)
Wait, you guys know Peter?

1704
01:38:31,651 --> 01:38:33,340
Are you kidding me?

1705
01:38:33,365 --> 01:38:34,948
Every Deadpool has a Peter.
Shit, Peter's a goddamn legend

1706
01:38:34,973 --> 01:38:37,505
in every Deadpool's world.

1707
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:39,212
Peter-san.
Hai

1708
01:38:39,237 --> 01:38:41,287
(dramatic music)

1709
01:38:49,321 --> 01:38:50,182
Enjoy my Peter.
(dramatic music)

1710
01:38:50,207 --> 01:38:51,466
(crashing)

1711
01:38:51,491 --> 01:38:52,934
Oh, now you're here.
Oh well, you're too late, it's all over.

1712
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:55,693
Not yet, it's not.

1713
01:38:55,718 --> 01:38:58,661
No, no, no, no, but we're very close.
Homestretch, folks, promise.

1714
01:38:58,686 --> 01:39:00,977
Quick, let's up the stakes.

1715
01:39:01,002 --> 01:39:03,064
If she steals the time ripper then,
she has the power to shred

1716
01:39:06,893 --> 01:39:08,720
the fabric of all the realities

1717
01:39:08,745 --> 01:39:10,029
until there is nothing left but the void.
How do we shut it down?

1718
01:39:10,071 --> 01:39:11,745
I don't know.

1719
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:13,572
How about now?
The mask is really intimidating, huh?

1720
01:39:13,597 --> 01:39:16,568
It's like Batman

1721
01:39:18,110 --> 01:39:19,857
except he can move his neck.
Okay, look, look, look, look, look.

1722
01:39:19,882 --> 01:39:21,818
(crashing)

1723
01:39:30,311 --> 01:39:32,198
The ripper is fed from a
secure chamber below ground.

1724
01:39:33,204 --> 01:39:34,938
It is powered by twin

1725
01:39:45,281 --> 01:39:46,682
matter and antimatter feeds
converging inside the device.

1726
01:39:46,707 --> 01:39:48,476
Now Cassandra Nova is

1727
01:39:48,501 --> 01:39:50,436
redirecting the ripper's power
to eliminate all

1728
01:39:50,461 --> 01:39:54,254
timelines, starting with this one.

1729
01:39:54,279 --> 01:39:55,922
Theoretically, you could stop her
by short circuiting the

1730
01:39:55,947 --> 01:39:57,858
feeds in the chamber below.

1731
01:39:57,883 --> 01:40:00,333
One of you would create a
circuit between the two feeds,

1732
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:04,746
then the released power

1733
01:40:04,771 --> 01:40:06,053
would destroy the machine.
But, well- Come on, man!

1734
01:40:06,078 --> 01:40:07,748
If you're not gonna swallow, spit it out.

1735
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:11,498
Whoever formed the
bridge would be annihilated.

1736
01:40:11,523 --> 01:40:13,668
I could live with that.

1737
01:40:13,693 --> 01:40:14,773
I could live with that too, actually.
You know, we survive anything.

1738
01:40:51,834 --> 01:40:53,374
We're like cockroaches he he he.

1739
01:40:53,399 --> 01:40:55,752
Not this time.
This is matter and antimatter.

1740
01:40:55,777 --> 01:40:57,152
They do not play nicely with each other.

1741
01:40:57,177 --> 01:41:00,420
When they mix in your
body, you will be atomized.

1742
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:01,935
Trust the laws of

1743
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:04,035
physics if you don't trust me.
Even if you lived long

1744
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:05,595
enough to make the circuit,

1745
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,275
you will die down there.
(dramatic music)

1746
01:42:15,018 --> 01:42:18,368
(electric pulsing)

1747
01:42:53,721 --> 01:42:55,114
Hold up, hold it.
You heard that asshole upstairs.

1748
01:42:55,139 --> 01:42:56,512
Even if we pull this off,

1749
01:42:56,537 --> 01:43:00,397
we're dead, permanently.
That's why it's gotta be me.

1750
01:43:05,485 --> 01:43:07,345
What?

1751
01:43:12,971 --> 01:43:15,861
Look, man, you didn't
ask for any of this.

1752
01:43:17,138 --> 01:43:19,777
You were right.

1753
01:43:19,802 --> 01:43:22,905
I lied.
I lied right to your face.

1754
01:43:33,008 --> 01:43:34,388
Just to get you to help me, you did.

1755
01:43:34,413 --> 01:43:35,976
You didn't lie.
You made an educated wish.

1756
01:43:36,001 --> 01:43:38,728
Come on.

1757
01:43:38,753 --> 01:43:39,833
You got a whole world to go back to.
I got nothing.

1758
01:43:41,529 --> 01:43:43,592
I got nothing.

1759
01:43:43,617 --> 01:43:46,214
Give me this.
Hey.

1760
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:49,965
(dramatic music)

1761
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:51,985
I waited a long time for this team up.
You know something?

1762
01:44:07,179 --> 01:44:09,732
You're the best Wolverine.

1763
01:44:35,708 --> 01:44:39,170
Say hi to your friends for me.
(dramatic music)

1764
01:44:39,195 --> 01:44:41,518
Open the door.

1765
01:44:41,543 --> 01:44:43,615
I can't hear you over all
the noble sacrifice.

1766
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:44,895
Why are you fucking doing this?

1767
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:50,805
Because I'm Marvel Jesus.
Or Spock.

1768
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:52,139
Hard to say.

1769
01:44:52,164 --> 01:44:52,934
Wade!
You fucking idiot.

1770
01:44:54,809 --> 01:44:55,815
(laughs)

1771
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,640
Sorry, I'm just stalling.
I think I'm nervous about dying.

1772
01:44:57,665 --> 01:45:00,435
It should be me.

1773
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:01,321
Say hi to my friends for me, Peanut.
Wade.

1774
01:45:02,204 --> 01:45:05,044
Way to be annoying prick,

1775
01:45:05,069 --> 01:45:07,991
You'll be sorry.
You're not gonna die again, you dumb fuck.

1776
01:45:08,016 --> 01:45:09,883
(dramatic music)

1777
01:45:09,908 --> 01:45:11,708
Wade, you don't need to do this.
I'm not doing it because I need it.

1778
01:45:11,733 --> 01:45:14,301
I'm doing it because they do.

1779
01:45:14,326 --> 01:45:17,809
(dramatic music)
No!

1780
01:45:17,834 --> 01:45:21,706
(dramatic music)

1781
01:45:21,731 --> 01:45:24,220
(dramatic music)
(crashing sound)

1782
01:45:24,245 --> 01:45:25,560
No!

1783
01:45:25,585 --> 01:45:27,672
All right.
(dramatic music)

1784
01:45:27,697 --> 01:45:30,867
He's not gonna make it.

1785
01:45:30,892 --> 01:45:32,608
(door bashing)
(dramatic music)

1786
01:45:32,633 --> 01:45:34,855
It's over.

1787
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,640
(dramatic music)
(dramatic drum beats)

1788
01:45:38,665 --> 01:45:43,701
("Like a Prayer" plays)

1789
01:45:43,726 --> 01:45:46,378
(dramatic music)
The Wolverine is a hero in my world.

1790
01:45:46,403 --> 01:45:51,574
Whoever you think I am,

1791
01:45:53,946 --> 01:45:56,478
you got the wrong guy.
You were always the wrong guy.

1792
01:46:15,789 --> 01:46:17,405
Till you weren't.

1793
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:22,549
(dramatic music)
Wade.

1794
01:46:22,574 --> 01:46:23,754
Wade, you can finally, finally, matter.

1795
01:46:23,883 --> 01:46:25,649
(dramatic music)
Vanessa. I wanna see Vanessa.

1796
01:46:25,674 --> 01:46:26,689
For the first time in

1797
01:46:30,102 --> 01:46:31,460
my life, I am proud.
To wear this suit.

1798
01:46:32,002 --> 01:46:35,245
It means I'm an X-man.

1799
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:39,290
I am the X-man.
(dramatic music)

1800
01:46:39,315 --> 01:46:41,882
(dramatic music)

1801
01:46:42,409 --> 01:46:44,062
(somber music)
Paradox.

1802
01:46:45,463 --> 01:46:47,131
You've been busy.

1803
01:46:50,268 --> 01:46:51,161
Well, somebody has been.
We had some strange

1804
01:46:51,956 --> 01:46:54,664
readings from this location.

1805
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:57,394
You wouldn't know anything about an
unsanctioned time ripper,

1806
01:46:59,149 --> 01:47:00,442
would you?

1807
01:47:04,967 --> 01:47:06,747
No, no, I wouldn't know anything
about an unsanctioned time ripper.

1808
01:47:12,994 --> 01:47:13,981
Maybe you should ask Cassandra Nova,

1809
01:47:18,352 --> 01:47:21,619
because I was assured that
she was safely held in the void.

1810
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,797
But no, she was here

1811
01:47:26,277 --> 01:47:28,397
and she fondled my brain.
How did you let this happen?

1812
01:47:36,156 --> 01:47:38,722
You weren't involved at all.

1813
01:47:51,041 --> 01:47:52,367
In stopping her, yes, yes, I was.
But not nearly enough.

1814
01:47:52,392 --> 01:47:55,260
Not as much as the men who

1815
01:47:55,285 --> 01:47:57,061
went down there after her.
My men, my friends,

1816
01:47:57,086 --> 01:48:00,101
I warned them, but they would be

1817
01:48:01,422 --> 01:48:03,525
completely obliterated
if they went, but they went anyway, like,

1818
01:48:03,550 --> 01:48:05,284
like heroes.

1819
01:48:11,289 --> 01:48:12,863
Because that's who they were.
They just did what they had to do.

1820
01:48:17,948 --> 01:48:19,820
With no concern for their own safety.

1821
01:48:19,845 --> 01:48:22,355
The fact that we are
all still standing here

1822
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:24,287
is a testament to their heroism.

1823
01:48:24,312 --> 01:48:27,113
Anyway, there's nothing you or I can do
to bring them back now.

1824
01:48:27,138 --> 01:48:29,290
He has risen baby girl

1825
01:48:29,315 --> 01:48:31,656
Fuck!
And I don't want the world to see me

1826
01:48:38,468 --> 01:48:41,431
Cause I don't think

1827
01:48:41,456 --> 01:48:43,758
that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken

1828
01:48:43,783 --> 01:48:46,137
I just want you to know who I am

1829
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:57,333
Found your new anchor being.
And we're doing just

1830
01:49:26,771 --> 01:49:28,485
fine you piece of shit.

1831
01:49:30,182 --> 01:49:30,862
Mm mm mm, fine indeed.
All right, put your greasy

1832
01:49:30,887 --> 01:49:31,656
tits away, you preening slut.

1833
01:49:37,342 --> 01:49:38,568
I don't understand.
How are you two still alive?

1834
01:49:40,995 --> 01:49:41,722
You're right, one of us

1835
01:49:43,062 --> 01:49:43,936
would have been killed.
But you put a Deadpool

1836
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:47,574
and a Wolverine together,

1837
01:50:48,214 --> 01:50:50,393
make them hold hands
while listening to Madonna?

1838
01:50:52,109 --> 01:50:55,516
Indestructible motherfucker.

1839
01:50:56,114 --> 01:50:58,280
Let's get this Deadpool
variant back to the void.

1840
01:50:59,494 --> 01:51:00,894
Wait, hold on, what?

1841
01:51:03,118 --> 01:51:03,878
Nope, actually, this one's homegrown.
Like me, he belongs here.

1842
01:51:06,122 --> 01:51:09,078
And you are?

1843
01:51:09,974 --> 01:51:11,974
Peter Pool.
But you can call me Peter.

1844
01:51:27,323 --> 01:51:28,717
And I hope that you do.

1845
01:51:31,230 --> 01:51:32,810
What the fuck is happening here?
You are under judgment

1846
01:51:38,033 --> 01:51:41,593
for operating an

1847
01:51:41,618 --> 01:51:43,172
unsanctioned time-ripper.
Take'em.

1848
01:51:44,152 --> 01:51:46,059
I was just doing what you

1849
01:51:48,527 --> 01:51:50,607
don't have the guts to do.
Get off, get off, your

1850
01:51:58,504 --> 01:52:01,711
insolent hands off me.

1851
01:52:33,907 --> 01:52:35,347
I'm grateful, gentlemen.
Let's hold the bows.

1852
01:52:36,966 --> 01:52:38,866
You led an Omega level

1853
01:52:38,891 --> 01:52:39,959
mutant to this timeline.
You're welcome.

1854
01:52:39,984 --> 01:52:45,702
And you shouldn't even

1855
01:52:45,727 --> 01:52:46,603
be near this timeline.
He's welcome.

1856
01:52:46,628 --> 01:52:49,429
And you look damn good in that suit.

1857
01:52:49,454 --> 01:52:51,132
I'm so sorry.
(beeping)

1858
01:52:51,157 --> 01:52:54,411
I wanna show you something.

1859
01:52:54,436 --> 01:52:56,996
Something huge.
That's what

1860
01:52:57,021 --> 01:52:59,014
Scoutmaster Kevin used to say.

1861
01:52:59,039 --> 01:53:02,934
Do you see that?
Your universe is regenerating.

1862
01:53:03,323 --> 01:53:06,289
Whatever you did here, you

1863
01:53:06,314 --> 01:53:07,770
not only saved your world,
you spared your timeline from extinction.

1864
01:53:07,795 --> 01:53:09,130
I'd rest up.

1865
01:53:10,632 --> 01:53:15,216
I have a feeling your work
is only just getting started.

1866
01:53:16,754 --> 01:53:18,734
Till you're 90.

1867
01:53:18,759 --> 01:53:22,284
Wait!
We couldn't have made it out of the void

1868
01:53:24,322 --> 01:53:27,072
without some help from some people

1869
01:53:27,097 --> 01:53:29,180
that the world kinda forgot.
Is there any way that

1870
01:53:32,382 --> 01:53:41,107
you could maybe find a way

1871
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:45,753
to bring them home?
I'll see what I can do.

1872
01:53:46,493 --> 01:53:49,466
And I promised my friend here

1873
01:53:49,491 --> 01:53:50,671
that the TVA could undo
some pretty awful shit

1874
01:54:08,822 --> 01:54:13,515
in his timeline.

1875
01:54:14,345 --> 01:54:15,998
What would you say to that?
Change the past?

1876
01:54:16,043 --> 01:54:20,763
He did help me save the world.

1877
01:54:20,851 --> 01:54:23,877
And his past made him the man who did it.
There's nothing to fix, Mr. Wilson.

1878
01:54:23,902 --> 01:54:25,842
Logan.

1879
01:54:26,362 --> 01:54:31,556
Shawarma?  I could eat yeah. 
You know the Avengers discovered Shawarma.

1880
01:54:31,581 --> 01:54:34,153
They'd be lucky to have you.

1881
01:54:34,178 --> 01:54:36,719
(dog barking)
Ohhhh

1882
01:54:36,744 --> 01:54:39,492
Fuck off!

1883
01:54:39,517 --> 01:54:41,609
Come here my little cuntshkin,
Yes it's you, you're a survivor.

1884
01:54:41,634 --> 01:54:42,767
Look, all is right in the world.

1885
01:54:42,792 --> 01:54:43,894
Yes it is.
So what are you gonna do next?

1886
01:54:43,919 --> 01:54:46,088
I'll figure it out.

1887
01:54:46,729 --> 01:54:48,291
I always do.
All right.

1888
01:54:54,443 --> 01:54:56,569
Well I'll probably see you around.

1889
01:54:56,594 --> 01:54:59,855
Probably not.
See you, bub.

1890
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:02,823
Logan!

1891
01:55:02,848 --> 01:55:04,328
Al, I'm back.
About damn time, you holding?

1892
01:55:04,353 --> 01:55:06,381
I'm all out of devil's dandruff

1893
01:55:07,882 --> 01:55:09,520
and I'm shaking like an angry vibrator.
Thank you, Al.

1894
01:55:09,634 --> 01:55:11,608
We have company.

1895
01:55:11,633 --> 01:55:15,129
Althea, this is Logan.
Nice to meet you, Logan.

1896
01:55:15,154 --> 01:55:18,230
Nice to meet you too.

1897
01:55:18,255 --> 01:55:19,633
And this little ancient,
anal shit-knot is Mary Puppins.

1898
01:55:19,658 --> 01:55:21,501
Or as I like to call her, Dogpool.

1899
01:55:21,526 --> 01:55:23,248
You wanna treat
yourself to a little stroke?

1900
01:55:26,789 --> 01:55:29,169
Get the tongue.

1901
01:55:29,405 --> 01:55:30,758
Oh my God, motherfucker!
Right, it's like an

1902
01:55:30,783 --> 01:55:33,577
armadillo fucked a gremlin,

1903
01:55:34,348 --> 01:55:35,803
angrily, in a bed of gonorrhea,
and didn't stop till the sun came up.

1904
01:55:35,828 --> 01:55:38,311
Everyone wants to matter.

1905
01:55:38,336 --> 01:55:40,478
Turns out that you don't need to be
Marvel Jesus to do it.

1906
01:55:40,503 --> 01:55:42,792
You just need to open

1907
01:55:42,817 --> 01:55:45,469
your eyes and look around.
And if you're lucky,

1908
01:55:46,845 --> 01:55:48,192
you'll find a few friends.

1909
01:55:48,495 --> 01:55:51,125
Old friends and some new ones too.
(soulful music)

1910
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:53,232
Give me the fucking

1911
01:55:53,273 --> 01:55:54,986
dog, talk to the girl.
(soulful music)

1912
01:55:55,011 --> 01:55:58,061
Oh, hi.

1913
01:55:59,629 --> 01:56:03,169
Hi.
You've been busy.

1914
01:56:03,194 --> 01:56:07,144
I did it for you.

1915
01:56:08,387 --> 01:56:09,943
Even if you don't want me, I did it for you.
Turns out, I am the world saving type.

1916
01:56:09,968 --> 01:56:13,143
Just look around this

1917
01:56:13,168 --> 01:56:17,516
table if you want proof.
And the best part,

1918
01:56:17,541 --> 01:56:19,236
sometimes the people we save,

1919
01:56:19,261 --> 01:56:21,524
well they save us right back.
("You’re All I Need to Get By" plays)

1920
01:56:21,875 --> 01:56:24,444
(Guitar strums)

1921
01:56:24,969 --> 01:56:28,382
You are not the only one with gifts.
What is this place?

1922
01:56:28,602 --> 01:56:30,035
("Good Riddance" by Green Day plays)

1923
01:56:33,274 --> 01:56:34,068
Another turning point
a fork stuck in the road

1924
01:56:34,093 --> 01:56:35,401
Time grabs you by the wrist

1925
01:56:44,362 --> 01:56:48,016
directs you where to go
So make the best of this test

1926
01:56:48,041 --> 01:56:50,472
and don't ask why

1927
01:56:57,260 --> 01:57:00,420
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
Nice suit.

1928
01:57:01,487 --> 01:57:03,420
Zip it Stan Lee.

1929
01:57:03,445 --> 01:57:06,476
("Good Riddance" continues playing)
I really like the art

1930
01:57:07,637 --> 01:57:12,475
in the Deadpool comics.

1931
01:57:13,702 --> 01:57:15,718
You know, I just always
felt kind of a kinship to him.

1932
01:57:15,949 --> 01:57:19,187
I just thought, I'd like to play that guy someday.

1933
01:57:19,212 --> 01:57:20,501
("Good Riddance" continues playing)
("Good Riddance" continues playing)

1934
01:57:21,493 --> 01:57:23,950
I was there for three weeks

1935
01:57:27,847 --> 01:57:29,214
before I shot a single thing.
For that first day of

1936
01:57:32,317 --> 01:57:33,697
shooting, I was so nervous, man.

1937
01:57:42,594 --> 01:57:43,641
Everyone was sort of
going, who's this guy.

1938
01:57:50,115 --> 01:57:50,969
You know, there was a lot of that.

1939
01:57:50,994 --> 01:57:52,435
You know, was he going to deliver or not
and you can feel all

1940
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:54,015
that kind of pressure.

1941
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:59,065
Always the suit's fault
Never the actor.

1942
01:57:59,090 --> 01:58:01,561
("Good Riddance" continues playing)

1943
01:58:01,586 --> 01:58:04,807
(screaming)
This is, the only way.

1944
01:58:04,832 --> 01:58:06,358
It's something unpredictable

1945
01:58:06,383 --> 01:58:07,704
But in the end, it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

1946
01:58:07,729 --> 01:58:10,997
Oh, this is what it feels like.

1947
01:58:11,022 --> 01:58:13,323
And there's the lights.
Medical research.

1948
01:58:13,348 --> 01:58:15,544
Bye bye, video.

(smootch)
(upbeat music)

1950
01:58:17,952 --> 01:58:20,130
I'm tired of these absolutely vile rumors

1951
01:58:20,155 --> 01:58:23,669
that I got Johnny killed.
Let's look at the tape.

1952
01:58:23,694 --> 01:58:27,983
In the void, you're either food for Alioth

1953
01:58:29,313 --> 01:58:31,253
or you work for her.
Go on, Johnny.

1954
01:58:31,278 --> 01:58:34,448
And I'll tell you who her is.

1955
01:58:34,873 --> 01:58:37,706
Cassandra Nova, a
megalomaniacal psychotic asshole.

1956
01:58:37,731 --> 01:58:40,988
A finger-licking dead inside pixie slab

1957
01:58:41,709 --> 01:58:46,424
of third rate dime store nut milk.
And I'll tell you what she can do.

1958
01:58:50,471 --> 01:58:52,937
I'm listening.

1959
01:59:02,823 --> 01:59:03,863
She can lick my
goddamn cinnamon ring clean

1960
01:59:03,888 --> 01:59:05,058
and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.

1961
01:59:07,675 --> 01:59:08,976
In fact, I don't give a
shit if she removes all my skin

1962
01:59:11,611 --> 01:59:13,650
and pops me like some

1963
01:59:15,369 --> 01:59:18,623
nightmarish blood balloon.
If the last thing I do

1964
01:59:27,319 --> 01:59:30,839
with this, God forsaken,

1965
01:59:30,864 --> 01:59:33,211
cum gutter existence,
is light that fuck box on a

1966
01:59:33,923 --> 01:59:35,323
fire I still won't die happy.

1967
01:59:35,348 --> 01:59:40,545
Holy shit, girl, you crazy.
That's right, Wade.

1968
01:59:45,255 --> 01:59:48,567
I won't be happy until I've urinated

1969
01:59:50,571 --> 02:00:03,247
on her freshly barbecued corpse
and husk fucked the charred remains

1970
02:00:20,462 --> 02:00:22,742
while gargling Juggernuts juggernuts.

1971
02:00:22,767 --> 02:00:24,002
Wow.
And you can quote me.
