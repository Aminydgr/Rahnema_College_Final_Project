# English to Persian Subtitle Translation Project
This project focuses on developing a machine translation system for converting English subtitles into Persian. Recognizing the importance of subtitles in conveying film meaning, we built a robust system using various machine translation models. The key components of the project include:

## Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Datasets sourced from literary works, Wikipedia, and subtitle repositories.
   - Created a parallel English-Persian corpus.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning, normalization, and tokenization.
   
3. **Model Implementation**:
   - Classical approaches: RNN, LSTM, Seq2Seq.
   - Transformer models: BART, T5.
   - Large language models: GPT-3.5, GPT-4o.
   
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Models were evaluated using the BLEU score.

5. **Dockerization**:
  - The project(T5 Model) was containerized for easier deployment using Docker and Flask for the API.
